We have presented \seidr{}, a dataplane assisted flow classification solution that can be used to detect fine-grained temporal flow behaviour. We have shown a PSA-compliant way to implement in-network data aggregation in the form of histograms, while using nanosecond-precision timestamping. Our in-network generated histogram datastructure (\eg, on per-flow packet inter-arrival times) has been presented as the input for various ML algorithms, including CNN and $k$-NN. We have shown with our extensive evaluation that \seidr{} can successfully tell apart TCP CCAs, in particular, it identifies BBR from its predecessors with over \SIrange{88}{96}{\percent} accuracy, while only consuming a maximum \SI{15.5}{\mebi\byte} of dataplane memory. We presented the trade-offs between training and inference times, memory requirements, and accuracy in the context of CNN and $k$-NN classifiers and shown that \seidr{} outperforms prior work by increasing classification accuracy on novel TCP CCAs, providing the ability to classify at very high traffic rates (in the order of \SI{10}{\tera\bit\per\second}).
Furthermore, we have identified a key temporal property of \emph{BBR} which allows its easy detection among other flows.
In the future, we aim to examine the use of \seidr{} towards microburst detection and diagnosis~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ChenFKRR18} and for the identification of \emph{BBR}-like temporal properties of emerging UDP-based congestion-aware protocols, such as \emph{QUIC}.%~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/LangleyRWVKZYKS17}.
