\chapter{Data-driven Networking}
Once we have any computer network as described above, we have a good basis for not only allowing two machines to communicate with one another, but also to do so \emph{efficiently}.
That isn't to say that there is no room to improve on how networks and operating systems provide this functionality.
Many aspects of modern networks, such as \glspl{acr:cca}, thresholds for differentiating services, and flow classification rely heavily upon hand-tuned heuristics.
As in \cref{sec:problems-in-modern-networks}, there is still vast scope to improve on communication latency and throughput, or to avoid and work around deleterious traffic patterns (such as incast communication).
As a result, research into \glspl{acr:cca}, network designs, and routing procedures is very much ongoing.
Crucially, as these operations lie at the core of network operation their solutions tend towards extremely efficient heuristic methods; they must be evaluated per-packet or react as quickly as possible to state change.
Designing new methods for network optimisation then requires deep insight into any problem, its edge cases, and the hardware/performance characteristics of the target environment.\sidenote{This affects how we design such heuristics even on commodity hosts---for instance, kernel-space \glspl{acr:cca} (i.e., as part of the TCP stack) are unable to use floating point arithmetic.}

Suppose that, as network administrators or protocol designers, we have access to a reasonable amount of information about the machines, network segments or \glspl{acr:as} under our control---measurements, observations, and statistics taken at run-time, from simulation, or by modelling.
A natural question to ask, then, is whether we can use this data to enhance and improve the operation and use of our network automatically.
Thinking further still, we might wonder whether we can outperform the general (yet useful) heuristics which are widely deployed and researched, allowing us to tailor network behaviour according to its environment and traffic patterns.
These questions are the founding principles of \gls{acr:ddn}\sidenote{Alternatively titled \emph{self-driving networks}.}, a recent field of research focussed on the automatic control and optimisation of network systems, which has sprung forth due to recent advances in \gls{acr:ml} and \gls{acr:rl}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/anrw/FeamsterR18,DBLP:journals/pieee/KellererKBBR019}.

The ideas and goals of automated network control have always existed and evolved in one form or another, particularly as computational inference and learning have grown more powerful.
Primarily, these ideas have propagated in their early forms via position papers offering a `vision of things to come'.
This was first famously formalised as the \emph{knowledge plane}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ClarkPRW03}, in contrast to the \emph{data} and \emph{control} planes.
This proposal captures not only the above concepts of automation as a means for network control, but also for collaborative or commercial sharing of information between end-hosts, transit \glspl{acr:as}, and organisations to build up a global picture of the needs of the network.
In truth, over the past \num{19} years we have moved no closer to such a unified substrate, though automated inference based on the data we \emph{do} have is richly researched.
A later attempt to combine this with \gls{acr:sdn} as \emph{Knowledge}-defined networking~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/MestresRCBASMMB16} takes key steps in clarifying the field, through concrete problems and promising \gls{acr:ml} developments, but effectively curtails the scale of knowledge sharing.
\gls{acr:ddn} itself is named and defined by \Textcite{DBLP:conf/comsnets/JiangSSZ17}, who again expand the scope for optimisation beyond network control to include \emph{end-points}; towards application and transport layer optimisation for hosts and servers, as well as control of the underlying fabric.

Starting out with the aim of emphasising and motivating the value of \gls{acr:ddn}, I discuss and introduce some of the recent developments and applications of \gls{acr:ml} and \gls{acr:rl} techniques in computer networking (\cref{sec:use-cases}), before then moving onto to explain the `building blocks' underlying these approaches.
Specifically, I introduce relevant function approximations (\cref{sec:function-approximation}), techniques to learn these representations including \gls{acr:rl} (\cref{sec:learning-an-approximation}), networked training (\cref{sec:ddn-collaborative-training}), and representations for different target devices (\cref{sec:numerical-representations-for-embedded-ml}).
\Cref{sec:ddn-challenges} discusses additional challenges inherent to \gls{acr:ddn}, while \cref{sec:ddn-security} then presents an overview of security perspective surrounding current \gls{acr:ml} and \gls{acr:ddn} approaches.
Although this context and its challenges are rapidly evolving, an understanding of security issues is key to offering a complete picture of the viability of \gls{acr:ddn} and the care which must be taken in its research.
Sadly, full examination and further development lies beyond the scope of this thesis---it is, in fact, a thesis-worthy topic in its own right~\parencite{papernot-thesis}.
