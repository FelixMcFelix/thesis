\chapter{Data-driven Networking}
Once we have any computer network as described above, we have a good basis for not only allowing two machines to communicate with one another, but also to do so \emph{efficiently}.
That isn't to say that there is no room to improve on how networks and operating systems provide this functionality.
Many aspects of modern networks, such as \glspl{acr:cca}, thresholds for differentiating services, and flow classification rely heavily upon hand-tuned heuristics.
As in \cref{sec:problems-in-modern-networks}, there is still vast scope to improve on communication latency and throughput, or to avoid and work around deleterious traffic patterns (such as incast communication).
As a result, research into \glspl{acr:cca}, network designs, and routing procedures is very much ongoing.
Crucially, as these operations lie at the core of network operation their solutions tend towards extremely efficient heuristic methods; they must be evaluated per-packet or react as quickly as possible to state change.
Designing new methods for network optimisation then requires deep insight into any problem, its edge cases, and the hardware/performance characteristics of the target environment.\sidenote{This affects how we design such heuristics even on commodity hosts---for instance, kernel-space \glspl{acr:cca} (i.e., as part of the TCP stack) are unable to use floating point arithmetic.}

Suppose that, as network administrators or protocol designers, we have access to a reasonable amount of information about the machines, network segments or \glspl{acr:as} under our control---measurements, observations, and statistics taken at run-time, from simulation, or by modelling.
A natural question to ask, then, is whether we can use this data to enhance and improve the operation and use of our network automatically.
Thinking further still, we might wonder whether we can outperform the general (yet useful) heuristics which are widely deployed and researched, allowing us to tailor network behaviour according to its environment and traffic patterns.
These questions are the founding principles of \gls{acr:ddn}\sidenote{Alternatively titled \emph{self-driving networks}.}, a recent field of research focussed on the automatic control and optimisation of network systems, which has sprung forth due to recent advances in \gls{acr:ml} and \gls{acr:rl}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/anrw/FeamsterR18,DBLP:journals/pieee/KellererKBBR019}.

The ideas and goals of automated network control have always existed and evolved in one form or another, particularly as computational inference and learning have grown more powerful.
Primarily, these ideas have propagated in their early forms via position papers offering a `vision of things to come'.
This was first famously formalised as the \emph{knowledge plane}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ClarkPRW03}, in contrast to the \emph{data} and \emph{control} planes.
This proposal captures not only the above concepts of automation as a means for network control, but also for collaborative or commercial sharing of information between end-hosts, transit \glspl{acr:as}, and organisations to build up a global picture of the needs of the network.
In truth, over the past \num{19} years we have moved no closer to such a unified substrate, though automated inference based on the data we \emph{do} have is richly researched.
A later attempt to combine this with \gls{acr:sdn} as \emph{Knowledge}-defined networking~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/MestresRCBASMMB16} takes key steps in clarifying the field, through concrete problems and promising \gls{acr:ml} developments, but effectively curtails the scale of knowledge sharing.
\gls{acr:ddn} itself is named and defined by \Textcite{DBLP:conf/comsnets/JiangSSZ17}, who again expand the scope for optimisation beyond network control to include \emph{end-points}; towards application and transport layer optimisation for hosts and servers, as well as control of the underlying fabric.

Starting out with the aim of emphasising and motivating the value of \gls{acr:ddn}, I discuss and introduce some of the recent developments and applications of \gls{acr:ml} and \gls{acr:rl} techniques in computer networking (\cref{sec:use-cases}), before then moving onto to explain the `building blocks' underlying these approaches.
Specifically, I introduce relevant function approximations (\cref{sec:function-approximation}), techniques to learn these representations including \gls{acr:rl} (\cref{sec:learning-an-approximation}), networked training (\cref{sec:ddn-collaborative-training}), and representations for different target devices (\cref{sec:numerical-representations-for-embedded-ml}).
\Cref{sec:ddn-challenges} discusses additional challenges inherent to \gls{acr:ddn}, while \cref{sec:ddn-security} then presents an overview of security perspective surrounding current \gls{acr:ml} and \gls{acr:ddn} approaches.
Although this context and its challenges are rapidly evolving, an understanding of security issues is key to offering a complete picture of the viability of \gls{acr:ddn} and the care which must be taken in its research.
Sadly, full examination and further development lies beyond the scope of this thesis---it is, in fact, a thesis-worthy topic in its own right~\parencite{papernot-thesis}.

%?? Find some cites citing the relevance of this problem wrt. self-driving cars, robotics, etc.

%The solution we propose is to make use of the recent wave of programmable network devices to \emph{bring reinforcement learning to the dataplane}---referring again to \cref{fig:state-slip}, we would place place state measurement ($t_1$), low-cost decision-making processes ($t_2$), and controlled systems ($t_3$) as close to one another as possible.
%In networks, actions are most likely to be installed on backbone switches, bump-in-the-wire NICs or middleboxes, and in the NICs of end-hosts.
%Ideally, these functions which comprise an RL agent would all be collocated on the same chip or device, but this is easier said than done. 
%Both programmable devices and the network environment make this more difficult, as we'll examine in the sequel.

\section{Collaborative training}\label{sec:ddn-collaborative-training}
While the main focus of this thesis is to investigate how \gls{acr:ml} or data-driven methods can benefit the network, there is equal interest in the asking instead \emph{how networking can benefit \gls{acr:ml}}.
Driven by the high compute-time requirements of modern \gls{acr:drl} and \gls{acr:dnn} training---in simulation, sample complexity, and raw input data---much community interest has been given to how networks can improve, accelerate, or innovate in \gls{acr:ml} model training.

I discuss briefly how networks offer distributed training, allowing models or datasets to be split over many worker nodes who all collaborate towards the training of a single \gls{acr:ml} model within a datacentre or cloud network.
This extends to brief discussion of novel ways to further optimise these processes as well as how they differ from traditional job scheduling.
Moving on, I discuss the frontier of this training task across far wider areas, network, or organisational boundaries---\acrfull{acr:fl}---alongside its limits.

%\subsection{Multiagent methods}

\subsection{Distributed training}
For various reasons, \gls{acr:ml} model training must often scale beyond several machines.
The most practical reason for this is that we can use the parallelism we have across a computing cluster to improve training performance---for instance, spreading minibatches across many machines allows us to compute more gradient update vectors in the same amount of time.
The scale of some modern \glspl{acr:nn} requires this; either due to the sheer size of the input dataset, or due to the size of the \gls{acr:nn} model itself.
This latter case requires some explanation; high-speed training requires \glspl{acr:gpu} which are capped on a single machine by the shared \gls{acr:pcie} bus, and in turn have limited cores or \gls{acr:vram}.
Due to this, a single \gls{acr:gpu} may be unable to store the entirety of a model and related structures or data, particularly when training infrastructure is shared.
The former and simpler use case, spreading training data across distributed nodes, is known as \emph{data parallel} training.
Dividing an \gls{acr:nn}'s compute graph across either local or remote accelerators is known as \emph{model parallel} training.
These concepts may be applied independently, or hybridised as necessary.
For context, consider the level of distributed compute required to train high-profile \gls{acr:drl} works such as the Dota-playing \emph{OpenAI Five}~\parencite{openai-five}---consuming \num{128000} \gls{acr:cpu} cores and \num{100} \glspl{acr:gpu}---or \emph{AlphaGo Fan}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/nature/SilverSSAHGHBLB17}---\num{176} \glspl{acr:gpu}. 	

%Paradigm instrumental in Big RL Successes. (link to all the OpenAI Stuff here).

However, effectively exploiting this parallelism is less simple in practice than in theory.
Device heterogeneity, different batch sizes and contents, and episode lengths in the \gls{acr:rl} case can all affect how long it takes any individual compute node to complete its own set of tasks.
Network behaviour such as transient load across paths or switches, worsened by incast traffic behaviour at central \glspl{acr:ps} when all workers transmit gradient vectors at the same time, all add to latency or cause lengthy retransmits in response to losses.
Moreover, we aim to minimise the amount of time that nodes remain inactive.
In the data parallel case, this is considered from two main directions:
\begin{description}
	\item[Parameter Server] approaches designate one or more servers who are responsible for holding the current version of a trained model.
	Worker nodes send their individual gradient updates to the \gls{acr:ps}, who aggregates all inputs and broadcasts the completed update to be applied~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nips/DeanCMCDLMRSTYN12,DBLP:conf/osdi/LiAPSAJLSS14}.
	Larger models reduce contention or bottlenecks by sharding portions of $\wvec{}$ across different \glspl{acr:ps}.
	These aggregate and broadcast steps may either be synchronous (as above) or \emph{asynchronous}, where workers do not wait to receive this broadcast vector before computing further updates (at the cost of losing model convergence guarantees as updates grow `stale').
	
	\item[AllReduce] techniques have workers transmit gradient updates to one another in a structured format to perform gradient aggregation without a \gls{acr:ps}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/cluster/MamidalaLP04,DBLP:conf/ipps/PatarasukY07}.
	These communication patterns may be ring structured (bandwidth-optimal, at the cost of $\mathcal{O}\left(n\right)$ latency) or structured as a binary tree.
\end{description}
Existing frameworks such as TensorFlow~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/AbadiABBCCCDDDG16} support these concepts via Horovod~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1802-05799}, Ray~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/MoritzNWTLLEYPJ18}, BytePS~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/JiangZLYCG20}, or recent designs such as Hoplite~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ZhuangLZWLNMS21}.\sidenote{It should be stated that gradient aggregation in general is simply the summation of all individual update vectors. This conceptually simple processing is what enables the task to be converted into a map-reduce workload so easily, but also enables many in-network approaches worth examining.}

Developing and optimising these distribution strategies is an ongoing line of work; consider that some works have seen that aggregating gradient updates consumes around \qty{83.2}{\percent} in the synchronous \gls{acr:ps} case~\parencite{DBLP:conf/isca/LiLYCSH19}, and that device heterogeneity can cause stragglers to greatly inflate latency in the AllReduce case.
In particular, different use cases or approximators (\gls{acr:rl}, \glspl{acr:gnn}) have different demands or characteristics; e.g., distributed \gls{acr:rl} policy updates are small and extremely frequent due to having an iteration count around an order of magnitude higher compared to \glspl{acr:nn} as classifiers~\parencite{DBLP:conf/isca/LiLYCSH19}.
Meanwhile, the explicit message-passing built into \glspl{acr:gnn} requires deliberate communication planning across nodes on one or many machines~\parencite{DBLP:conf/eurosys/Cai0WMCY21,DBLP:conf/eurosys/WangY0YCYYZ21}.

Distributed \gls{acr:ml} training has been found to exhibit different cluster use characteristics from other job scheduling tasks.
Work remains common on minimising \glspl{acr:jct}, wasted resource use (i.e., dollar cost to the user) and other sources of contention in the network.
These include \gls{acr:rl}-based policies such as \emph{MLFS}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/conext/0002LS20}, which optimise job and cluster performance with awareness of overfitting, dynamic downscaling of per-task resources~\parencite{DBLP:conf/eurosys/MisraLDBKGST21}, and fair sharing and allocaiton between different \gls{acr:gpu} classes~\parencite{DBLP:conf/eurosys/ChaudharyRSKV20}.
More recent works include explicit short-job prioritisation alongside that of jobs likely to maximise model accuracy increases combined with the above class of elastic scaling~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/HwangKKSP21}.
Indeed, there have been suggestions from the research community that even the underlying transports protocols or \glspl{acr:cca}---including RoCE~\parencite{rocev2} and \gls{acr:tcp}---are at fault in bottlenecks rather than bandwidth~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ZhangCLWAJ20}.
Of course, this does not preclude the development of specialised optical interconnects~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ShirkoohiGAZGBV21} to provide extremely high-bandwidth, reliable circuit-switched communications between nodes.

Recalling the large amount of time spent centrally aggregating parameter updates in \gls{acr:ps} methods (in addition to heavy incast behaviour), it is clear they have several disadvantages over AllReduce in exchange for lower latency.
\emph{In-switch} aggregation approaches have been proposed to remedy these issues such that the update vectors are aggregated \emph{en-route} to the \gls{acr:ps}, ensuring not only that the \gls{acr:ps} itself performs less work, but also minimises its inbound packet volume.
\emph{iSwitch}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/isca/LiLYCSH19} uses NetFPGA-SUME hardware to implement special handling for RL model update packets, building floating-point adders and limited storage space into bump-in-the-wire \glspl{acr:nic} to achieve \qtyrange{3.66}{3.71}{\times} faster training.
\emph{SwitchML}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/SapioC0NKKKMPR21} converts a programmable \gls{acr:tor} switch \emph{into a \gls{acr:ps}}, offering this as a P4 program built on fixed-point quantisation.
\emph{ATP}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/LaoLMCWAS21} extends this to a best-effort service and custom transport protocol in front of the true \gls{acr:ps}, falling back to floating point on detection of overflows and offering better support for several dynamic jobs.
However, this family of optimisations can only be applied when two gradient packets are able to meet in the network excluding, e.g., ring AllReduce.
I discuss implementation specifics in more detail through \cref{sec:in-network-computation}, and some rationale in \cref{sec:numerical-representations-for-embedded-ml}.

%?? communication and compute can be cleverly overlapped and optimised
Techniques such as \emph{Wait-Free Backpropagation}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/ZhangZXDHLHWXX17,DBLP:conf/ppopp/AwanHHP17} have enabled tighter optimisation of when individual gradient parts can be set out and used to optimise for a compute-communication tradeoff.
This can be combined with gradient sparsification to achieve reduced bandwidth~\parencite{DBLP:conf/infocom/ShiWCLQLZ20}, and further optimised for \gls{acr:ps}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/infocom/WangLG20} and AllReduce~\parencite{DBLP:conf/infocom/BaoPCW20} communication patterns.
Moreover, \glspl{acr:gnn} have been used to dynamically optimise hybrid aggregation strategies and model/data parallelism across heterogeneous \gls{acr:gpu} clusters~\parencite{DBLP:conf/conext/0001ZLLDWZYL20}.

\subsection{Federated learning}
The key driver behind distributed training is the idea that disparate and networked resources within a single organisation can be used together to accelerate (or even make feasible) the training of complex \gls{acr:dnn} models.
A more difficult question that has arisen since is how best to achieve this between \emph{several} organisations, or even weaker devices in consumers' hands or the edge of the Internet.

\acrfull{acr:fl}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/KonecnyMRR16,DBLP:journals/corr/Konecny17,DBLP:conf/mlsys/BonawitzEGHIIKK19} allows several unaffiliated devices to independently train local \gls{acr:ml} models from the data available to them.
The main goal of \gls{acr:fl} is to train a high-quality, centralised model, potentially including local or device-specific optimisations, when input data are divided unevenly over a large number of nodes.
Crucially, we require that training remains effective when such data are non-\gls{acr:iid} across these devices.
The key intuition is that we can make use of device-local intelligence to train our model.
By having any device update its parameter set locally, a node collects its set of combined gradients which are then sent to the parameter server; these are collected as above, and a new canonical model may be published to all users.
This saves computing cost at the central parameter server, bandwidth consumption due to the large size and total volume of training samples, and (in principle) protects the privacy of users with regard to sensitive or personally identifying input data.

The original solution~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/KonecnyMRR16} requires that each node solves a subproblem subject to some quadratic perturbation, combining DANE~\parencite{DBLP:conf/icml/ShamirS014} and Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nips/Johnson013}.
Much of the algorithmic developments are dedicated to correcting for potential sources of bias from the edge-node results before they are combined.
This includes weighting contributions by each node's proportion of input samples and the distribution of non-zero values in these input data.
This was first adapted to more non-convex functions (i.e., \glspl{acr:dnn}) by \textcite{DBLP:conf/aistats/McMahanMRHA17}.
Notably, they \emph{only} make use of this weighted averaging step---which they claim has an inherent regularisation effect analogous to dropout---yet achieve respectable training performance.
Crucially, they raise the point that all candidate models must be at the very least be initialised from the same seed or master policy.
More recent work examines the possibility of applying \gls{acr:rl} to better handle non-\gls{acr:iid} input data by selecting the gradient vectors to include in an update round at runtime~\parencite{DBLP:conf/infocom/WangKNL20}.

\gls{acr:fl} has since been divided into two classes:
\begin{description}
	\item[Cross-device \gls{acr:fl}] covers the above motivating case, where contributing devices are assumed to be mobile or \gls{acr:iot} devices.
	\item[Cross-silo \gls{acr:fl}] describes this paradigm applied to shared learning \emph{between} organisations. This formulation applies far stricter privacy guarantees: the parameter server must be unable to see the learned model (but is still responsible for hosting and updating it), and organisations must limit the ability to extract or infer personally identifying information from the trained model.
\end{description}

The latter case introduces additional engineering and design challenges, and is a topic of ongoing research.
\emph{Secure aggregation}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/ccs/BonawitzIKMMPRS17} has been proposed such that gradient combination is pushed down to clients who have randomised communication patterns with one another, while the only final model change is exposed to the parameter server.
Homomorphic encryption hides this from even the central server without requiring that hosts perform piecewise aggregation: arithmetic operations applied between a pair of ciphertexts behave as though applied to the clear texts.
\emph{BatchCrypt}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/ZhangLX00020} applies this to batches of integer-quantised gradients, where batching and sparsification are the key tricks needed to reduce the heavy bandwidth of homomorphic ecnryption.
This is then improved upon in bandwidth overheads, encryption time, and aggregation cost by \emph{FLASHE}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2109-00675}, which moves to a simpler \emph{symmetric} cryptosystem that supports only \emph{addition}.
When considering whitebox attacks of the form discussed throughout \cref{sec:ddn-security} such as data reconstruction attacks~\parencite{DBLP:conf/icml/LamW0RM21}, cross-silo \gls{acr:fl} often draws on differential privacy literature~\parencite{DBLP:conf/iclr/McMahanRT018}.

%FL with Homomorphic Encryption~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/ZhangLX00020,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2109-00675} -- Check FLASHE for good cites and discussion of issues introduced by homeomorphic encryption.

%?? Explcitly describe the requirement for locally-acquired labels.

\gls{acr:fl} as a paradigm is limited in how it can be deployed to solve supervised tasks.
As each node, device or organisation must contribute gradient information that \emph{they themselves have locally sourced}, we can see that in supervised problems this mandates that these nodes must also be able to label the data themselves somehow.
To get the high volume of data required to overcome \glspl{acr:dnn}' sample complexity, input data must either be trivially user-labelled data, effectively self-labelling (i.e., known at a later time), or arise through time-series forecasting.
For instance, predictive text~\parencite{federated-learning-blog} was used as one of the first large-scale use cases by Google---an input datum is a word the user had typed, and its label is either the chosen suggestion \emph{or} what they themselves typed instead.
Naturally, there is still applicability in semi-supervised or unsupervised techniques like autoencoders~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ftml/KingmaW19} which can be cast as a gradient descent problem.

%?? Issue? Only works on certain problems (explicitly unsupervised, or easy to acquire local supervised measurements).
%
%Okay, what conditions does it impose on the type of data we want to use for training (right now, at least)?
%?? Need trivially (user-)labelled data, to get the high volume we need. (label-able at the edge nodes? is unsupervised remotely worthwhile?)
%?? Ex: predictive text works (data is word the user had typed, label is what they picked from the dict OR what they typed by the end.)

%Invented by \textcite{DBLP:journals/corr/KonecnyMRR16}.
%?? (Probably look at the lead author's shiny new PhD Thesis \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Konecny17}? Look for more of his stuff?)
%?? IDEA -- train a high-quality centralised model when data are divided unevenly over a large number of nodes (read: non-IID).
%?? Main problem is that the best-performing algorithms are very much sequential in nature. Even then, many make assumption that all learners see a representative sample.
%?? Each node solves a subproblem subject to some quadratic perturbation (as in DANE \cite{DBLP:conf/icml/ShamirS014} (not read!)) but for Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG).
%?? Much of the algorithm is correcting for potential sources of bias from the edge-node results before they are combined (averaged very carefully).

%\textcite{DBLP:conf/aistats/McMahanMRHA17} examine:
%?? Federated Learning to train deep neural nets.
%?? More broadly, this looks at non-convex loss functions in general.
%?? New Algo---FedAVG seems to outperform FedSVG despite having fewer terms to correct for bias. I've written that it's analogous to dropout (which itself can offer behaviour close to a Bayesian net), check again to see what exactly this refers to.
%?? Core idea---still essentially just taking (weighted) average of the policies from edge learners. Pretty important that they're all initialised from the same seed, at least then. Better convexity behaviour than expected.

\section{Numerical representations for embedded ML}\label{sec:numerical-representations-for-embedded-ml}
A key feature universally lacking from the target environments is floating-point arithmetic support.
Luckily, the task of bringing machine learning models to resource-constrained environments without these capabilities is well-studied.
Quantisation and alternative data formats have been suggested to make ML inference feasible on resource- and power-limited platforms, work around hardware constraints, or compute faster and more efficiently.
Lower bit depths reduce memory footprints, and improve throughput in designs such as \emph{bfloat16}~\parencite{bfloat16-blog} in Google TPUs~\parencite{DBLP:journals/sigops/XieDMKVZT18} and modern Intel Xeon server \glspl{acr:cpu}~\parencite{intel-bfloat}, \emph{hfp8}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nips/SunCCWVSCZG19}, and other floating point formats~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-01530}.
In many cases, accuracy losses for doing so are negligible.
Much of this work goes further still towards integer~\parencite{tensorrt-8bit} or binarised~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/MiyashitaLM16,DBLP:conf/eccv/RastegariORF16,DBLP:journals/corr/KimS16,DBLP:conf/nips/HubaraCSEB16} representations, sacrificing dynamic range for simpler arithmetic operations.
The works mentions above use similar techniques to make inference tractable on network hardware, i.e., to bring neural networks to the dataplane~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2009-02353,DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SanvitoSB18,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-05731}.

?? Expand on all this crap, maybe take some time to actually explain fixed-point.

To make RL workloads feasible under such constraints, we propose the use of quantised, fixed-point representations such as $Qm.n$ (i.e., $m$\si{bit} signed integers with an $n$\si{bit} fractional part), which allow us to evaluate and update policies using only integer arithmetic.
This is not only essential in performing this work, but also serves as a mechanism for reducing the processing and memory costs of function approximation ($t_2$, \cref{fig:state-slip}).

When combined with the above P4-driven techniques for in-network flow/device measurement, we at last have the mechanisms to collocate the key processes of an RL agent.
Moreover, the base P4 dataplane can be used to simplify parsing logic and offer runtime control over which flows/packets are monitored, alongside other packet actions.
This again fits our goals of integrating RL techniques directly within bump-in-the-wire installations and at end-hosts.

?? New work on training \qty{8}{\bit} \glspl{acr:dnn} on-device~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/Zhou0QGXZGLZ21}

\section{Challenges}\label{sec:ddn-challenges}

?? Include some good, high-level discussion of sensitivity to training environment (i.e., many authors willing to use traces) \textcite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/BartulovicJBSS17}, yet there's still interesting use-cases in being able to do so \textcite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/LecuyerLNSSS17}.
?? Main problem with traces: not modelling/learning how the controlled system acts in response to change.
?? Opinion: this is a holdover from the initial wave of people throwing ML algos at datasets and getting papers out. Even the correct handling of this (i.e., using RL to solve static problem instances derived like NP-optimisation problems) limits the field in my opinion.
?? "includes the tacit assumption that the model will not change in response to the input", which is as true in science as it is in Human systems (a view I am not alone in sharing (cite Hamming book))
?? although it can be difficult to know ahead of time, it's worth considering whether the problem ``bites back'' or is adversarial in some way; an ongoing control problem is altogether different from an offline optimisation task. It's unlikely that in an optimised chip allocation, programs will immediately start acting differently (as compared to a network where our actions induce various modes in \glspl{acr:cca})

?? Seems to always require dedicated co-design? (https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/fu)

\subsection{Attacks on Data-Driven Techniques}\label{sec:attacks-on-data-driven-techniques}

?? Older taxonomy, includes what we now call poisoning, evasion~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/BarrenoNSJT06}. Is there an updated?

?? White-box attacks -- evasion, adversarial examples, etc.

\paragraph{Poisoning Attacks}
?? Attacker wants to (permanently) alter the behaviour of a system which is still training in some way.
The key intuition is that an attacker wishes to affect which data points are used in training, and in turn affect the decision boundaries to do... something bad?

?? For systems which assume a stable (stationary) form of normality, it takes an exponential amount of packets with respect to how far the mean must move.
Yet in systems which use a finite number of data points (i.e. modelling non-stationarity) an attacker requires only a linear amount of data if they control a sufficient fraction of the network throughput.
Further findings are more optimistic: if the attacker controls insufficient traffic, then they cannot succeed in appreciably shifting the mean with even an infinite amount of traffic.
It isn't made clear how these findings relate to more complex systems or models, but it will remain an important consideration. \cite{DBLP:journals/jmlr/KloftL10}

?? More modern cite?

\paragraph{Evasion Attacks/Adversarial Examples}

?? Be clear---this is still evolving today!

?? Yeah these are a thing (note: haven't actually read most of these aside from the wonderful turtle-rifle 3d printer one).
?? The one, the only, the original \parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/SzegedyZSBEGF13}, the application \parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/GoodfellowSS14}.
?? Second one here suggests that part of the weakness is that models fall back on their heavily linear components -- verify this.

?? Most recently summed up in the SoK paper by \textcite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/PapernotMSW18}.

?? Where are we now? Transform invariant (i.e., photographs \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/KurakinGB16}, 3D model \& 2D transforms \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/AthalyeS17}): what does this mean with regards to the transforms we apply to our input data?

A more recent formalisation and strengthening of attacks based on raw input data was recently presented by \textcite{DBLP:conf/sp/Carlini017}.
Around the time of publication, distillation \cite{DBLP:conf/sp/PapernotM0JS16} was proposed as a form of hardening for neural networks expected to perform in adversarial settings where evasion attacks might be common.
This work reveals that existing approaches for generating adversarial examples \emph{weren't strong enough} and, accordingly, approaches like defensive distillation are shown to be ineffective.
Some future works refer to the methods they propose as CW-$L_{\{0, 2, \infty\}}$ attacks, according to the target data distance metric to be minimised (respectively, the Hamming, Euclidean and Chebyshev metrics).
Their attacks exceed existing work based on these three well-understood metrics by a more in-depth analysis of the construction of cost functions, a reworked box constraint built around $\tanh(\cdot)$ (as in HDR image tone mapping), and a more nuanced treatment of the effects of discretisation error.
By introducing a \emph{confidence factor} $\kappa$, they are able to explicitly design attacks which are \emph{transferable} between one classifier and its distilled form, or a network derived from the original by black box inference.
All attacks are computed by way of a general stochastic optimiser, such as \emph{Adam} \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/KingmaB14}.
Their work currently establishes the benchmark for future mitigation techniques.

While it is feasible that an attacker could start with a \emph{white-box} understanding of your model to aid in evasion, a more feasible situation is the case where they do not.
\textcite{DBLP:conf/uss/TramerZJRR16} have shown that attackers can infer many classes of learned models from observation (\emph{model extraction attacks}), allowing evasion attacks, model cloning or discovery of confidential training data characteristics.
They are able to demonstrate model extraction on logistic regressors, SVMs, MLPs and NNs with and without confidence values.
Furthermore, from their retrained models they are able to extract images of faces which are ``visually indistinguishable'' from the real training data of a facial recognition classifier.
As far as defences go, they recommend: hiding or rounding confidence values (to limited success); applying differential privacy to mode parameters (an open question); and ensemble methods (which may still be beaten by evasion attacks).

?? RL algorithms based on NNs are just as vulnerable \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HuangPGDA17}!

?? New work \parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2002-04599} covering the balancing attack between sensitivity/invariance-based attacks. Sensitivity is what we usually think of (small change which doesn't impact the true label), invariance is a change which \emph{would} change the true label, but is performed in such a way that the model still outputs the old label. Implication: defending against one makes you more sensitive to the other (specifically, attacks within some $\ell_p$ norm ball)---even more sensitive than an undefended network.
?? Even modern provably robust systems based on $\ell_\infty$ \parencite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhangCXGSLBH20} are vuln.

\subsection{Defences on above}

?? DIstillation, other papers I read ages ago.

?? Mine the relevant conferences for more...

\paragraph{Poisoning}
?? Poisoning defences. Auror \cite{DBLP:conf/acsac/ShenTS16} relies upon the fact that masked features (i.e. gradient updates) submitted by users tend to have a known distribution.
By performing 2-means cluster detection on \emph{indicative features}, users whose updates consistently fall outside of the benign distribution may be detected and blacklisted.

\paragraph{Evasion}

?? \textcite{DBLP:conf/sp/PapernotM0JS16}---distillation---not read.

In ensemble classification, if many of the individual classifiers disagree then this can represent a high degree of uncertainty about the observed data.
\textcite{DBLP:conf/ndss/SmutzS16} realise that this uncertainty can act as a powerful indicator of an evasion attack in progress, and propose \emph{mutual agreement analysis} as a defence.
When an insufficient amount of the constituent classifiers return the same result, the result returned is that the sample is `uncertain'---suggesting either a new class of data or evidence of attempted evasion.
The approach naturally suits ensemble methods such as \emph{random forests}, but an extension to SVMs is proposed (an ensemble of feature-bagged SVMs); both are shown to be more effective than standard learning in the face of evasion, mimicry and reverse mimicry attacks.
Moreover, the addition of the `uncertain' classification acts as a useful metric for continuous training and evolution.

Adversarial examples typically occur very close to the decision hyperplane; applying too much noise can either accidentally `push' the data into a classification the attacker did not desire, or it may become humanly perceptible.
This principle is exploited by \textcite{DBLP:conf/acsac/CaoG17}, who propose ensemble classification of potentially adversarial data by sampling from the local hypercube---\emph{region-based} classification, rather than standard \emph{point-based} classification.
This differs from the previous approach; we consider here an ensemble of \emph{classifications} around one data point, rather than an ensemble of \emph{classifiers}.
This approach is remarkable because it may rely on any existing classifier $\mathcal{C}$.
This draws from the observation that most of the volume of the surrounding hypercube (of length $r$) lies within the true class region, even for adversarial examples.
To learn the true class of an example, we must then choose the class which admits the largest volume of overlap with the sample region: we may approximate this by drawing samples uniformly from this hypercube (e.g., \num{10000} points), labelling them with the chosen $\mathcal{C}$ and observing the output histogram.
$r$ is chosen such that classifier performance on benign examples does not degrade below that of $\mathcal{C}$.
Given that this design is non-differentiable, an attacker cannot compose an adversarial attack directly even if they know $r$, the sample count and $\mathcal{C}$ exactly---they must craft examples against $\mathcal{C}$ (which \emph{is} differentiable) and use these.
Detection of the standard set of attacks \cite{DBLP:conf/sp/Carlini017} is shown by very convincing results, meaning that attackers must amplify the applied noise, again risking an incorrect target class or very perceptible distortion.
An interesting area that isn't discussed is how different sampling distributions might affect robustness in the face of even this.

?? Newest on these?~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1902-06705}. Attempts to offer concrete methodology in response to very variable analysis/testing and slow research on defences. Most defences posited in response to the rapid development of attacks are shown to be incorrectly or incompletely evaluated. ?? Human and machine classification/decision-making performance are tied in efficacy, while there remains a huge gap between sensitivity to adversarial examples. The norm is to assume attackers have white-box access, because this includes black-box defence.

\section{Summary}
Eh.

\subsection{Efficient policy approximation}
Some problems either evolve over time in unpredictable ways, or cannot be easily modelled.
This can then make \emph{online} learning of the task an attractive prospect, using a single available stream of experience.
\emph{Deep neural networks} (DNNs), particularly when used as the basis for an RL agent's policy, require vast amounts of experience to converge on an accurate parameter set.
In many problem domains, this equates to training from compute-years worth of distributed offline simulations, which is at odds with the need to adapt to changes in the underlying problem \emph{as they happen}.
Achieving stable learning requires sizeable batches of gradients to be computed, potentially using the entire experience replay from each simulation.
Although there has been a vested interest in efficiently \emph{executing} more complex function approximators such as DNNs in-NIC~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2002-08987,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2009-02353,DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SanvitoSB18,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1801-05731,langlet-ml-netronome}, the computational cost of gradient computation via backpropagation remains too significant on embedded hardware.

%?? Probably want some cites on the need for batching in NN methods, even though this is understood. DL book?

We then return again to what classical RL methods can offer us; in particular, the simple linear function approximation given by \emph{tile coding} \cite[pp.\ \numrange{217}{221}]{RL2E}.
The idea is simple: a policy is represented by sets of tiles, each covering one or more dimensions of the input state with several overlapping tilings (offset stepwise to provide generalisation).
A state vector produces a single `hit' in each tiling, which provides both the set of action preference lists to sum during inference \emph{and} the set of tiles to update at the next timestep.
Crucially, this internal representation ensures that there are no data dependencies between any tile hit calculations for an input state vector.
This has important benefits for parallelisation.
To select an action, we can produce a task for each tiling---retrieving the list of action values contributed by the tile activated by the input state.
An aggregate step sums up all action preference lists, and the action with the highest value is then selected.
Updating the policy (with a new $\delta_t$ value) has no aggregate step, and as tile indices map to disjoint memory regions no locks are required.

For instance, a policy with $m$ sets of tiles (each having its own set of input dimensions), each containing $n$ overlapping tilings then creates $m \times n$ separate tasks.\sidenote{Retrieving each individual action's value can be considered a work item (giving $m \times n \times a$ tasks when there are $a$ actions). However, this requires the tile coding operation to repeated $a$ times per tile, which is likely extremely wasteful outside of extreme degrees of parallelism.}
As an example, a real-world policy size which we examine later (\cref{sec:experimental-setup}) with one bias tile and \num{16} sets containing \num{8} tilings creates \num{129} work items.

Computing a tile hit requires one division per dimension, which is an expensive addition to the ALU operations we require from a platform.
However, if the width of tiles are fixed at powers-of-two, then these may be replaced with right bitshifts.
As we shall see shortly, this aligns with our choice of numerical representation.
