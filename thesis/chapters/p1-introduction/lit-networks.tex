\chapter{Computer Networks}\label{sec:ch-networks}\label{chap:nets}

?? What are networks?

?? Possibly discuss the internet

?? Lead in from ARPAnet et al. (2 paras). Scientific comms -> general use,

\section{Operation and Management}

?? network-network comms? BGP

?? IGP?

?? packets routed on a per-hop basis from their perspective: may be higher level in practice (MPLS, path switching within a gateway)

?? How can we examine this? High-level (above), mid-level ()

?? Two axes: end-to-end protocol and fabric behaviour. interact in a very delicate way (i.e., host )

?? named-data networking as potential structure of the Internet?~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/0001ABJcCPWZ14}
?? Can I use this to suggest/outline problems which might be solved/encountered in a future Internet?

?? Talk about \gls{acr:as} families here: \glspl{acr:isp}, hypergiants~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/GigisCMNKDKS21}...
?? Data centres: refer to e.g. google Espresso [sigcomm 2017] as big SDN deployments

\subsection{Fixed-Function Hardware}

\subsection{Software-Defined Networking}

?? Run through the historical context. Why? What led into P4 (OpenFlow, network operating systems...)

?? \gls{acr:ovs}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/PfaffPKJZRGWSSA15} huge here.

?? A survey to mine for stuff~\parencite{DBLP:journals/comsur/NunesMNOT14}

?? Tie into PDP here: active networking and TPP . Think about the concept of protocol boosters~\parencite{DBLP:journals/jsac/FeldmeierMSBMR98}. (NOT READ)

\section{Traffic Characteristics}

?? Can (and should probably) discuss different traffic classes here: congestion-aware, -unaware...

?? Note, explain that this is NOT just TCP vs UDP due to existence of SCTP over UDP (See: DTLS in WebRTC), QUIC over UDP, ...

?? Chain this into \glspl{acr:cca}

?? Explain why you need what.

?? Historical context for their inclusion?

?? Discussion of evolution of traffic: what's come before, what's coming next.
?? Look for older in my old notes, but recent cite here~\parencite{DBLP:conf/anrw/BauerJHBC21}.

?? Describe all my CAIDA analysis here
?? analysis of CAIDA datasets~\parencite{caida-2018-passive}
?? congestion-aware traffic makes up at least \qtyrange{73}{82}{\percent} of packets\sidenote{\url{https://github.com/FelixMcFelix/caida-stats}}
?? Also talk about QUIC's prevalence here

\subsection{Evolution}

\subsection{Emerging Protocols}

?? QUIC~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/LangleyRWVKZYKS17}

?? QUIC carries \gls{acr:http} traffic, mostly...

\subsection{Limitations}

\section{Problems in Modern Networks}\label{sec:problems-in-modern-networks}

\subsection{Attacks on the Internet}

?? DDoS -> split by type.

?? Other attacks?

\subsection{Scaling}

\subsection{Fairness}

\section{Summary}
Eh.
