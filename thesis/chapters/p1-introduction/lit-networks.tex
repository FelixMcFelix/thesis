\chapter{Computer Networks}

?? What are networks?

?? Possibly discuss the internet

?? Lead in from ARPAnet et al. (2 paras). Scientific comms -> general use,

\section{Operation and Management}

?? network-network comms? BGP

?? IGP?

?? packets routed on a per-hop basis from their perspective: may be higher level in practice (MPLS, path switching within a gateway)

?? How can we examine this? High-level (above), mid-level ()

?? Two axes: end-to-end protocol and fabric behaviour. interact in a very delicate way (i.e., host )

\subsection{Fixed-Function Hardware}

\subsection{Software-Defined Networking}

?? Run through the historical context. Why? What led into P4 (OpenFlow, network operating systems...)

\section{Traffic Characteristics}

?? Can (and should probably) discuss different traffic classes here: congestion-aware, -unaware...

?? Historical context for their inclusion?

?? Discussion of evolution of traffic: what's come before, what's coming next.

\subsection{Evolution}

\subsection{Emerging Protocols}

\subsection{Limitations}

\section{Problems in Modern Networks}\label{sec:problems-in-modern-networks}

\subsection{Attacks on the Internet}

?? DDoS -> split by type.

?? Other attacks?

\subsection{Scaling}

\subsection{Fairness}

\section{Summary}
Eh.
