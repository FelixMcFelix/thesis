\chapter{Programmable Computer Networks}\label{sec:ch-networks}\label{chap:nets}
Computer networks serve the important function of allowing any two machines to communicate with one another, typically via individual messages know as packets (i.e., a packet-switched network).
Naturally, reality is much more complex than this broad statement would otherwise let on; the local routing fabric in a modern network comprises specialised (though commonplace) hardware for correctly routing these packets through arbitrary topologies of links and switches at ever-increasing data rates.
This grows more complicated still when we consider the task of \emph{inter}networking between such networks, where we must route packets on higher-level logically structured addresses between different domains of control according to fairly complex policies and relationships.
At the inception of these technologies, computer scientists of the day wisely decided that the sole duty of the network itself should be the correct routing of individual packets.
Their view was that application-level logic should be executed solely at endpoint machines; their definition extended, of course, to even include desirable (and some would say indispensable) transport-level properties such as error checking and stream reliability.
This is known as the \emph{end-to-end principle}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/tocs/SaltzerRC84}.
This position arose partly due to the logical complexity of all the tasks pushed onto the network at this time, as well as the need to ensure optimal forwarding performance while microprocessors were still relatively nascent, but was instrumental in ensuring that the network itself remained \emph{extensible}.
A consistent, pared down feature set ensured while offering a good degree of freedom for the development and deployment of higher-level protocols.

Decades have passed since then, and to a large extent the zeitgeist has shifted on just how capable our networks should be---in both the research community and operators of large-scale networks.
Consider the case where an operator has a fully converged network built entirely on fixed-function hardware, but wishes to use some program to inspect the behaviour, state, and characteristics of some flow between two local machines.
The problem is that these devices offer no means of modifying or influencing routing state, being highly-optimised switching devices that understand a selection of routing algorithms built into their internal circuitry.
For the longest time, altering the network's routing behaviour in this instance---even for a single override---required not only physically altering and rewiring the network, but also would require additional hardware.\sidenote{Revisit this later... maybe a better example will come to me?}
\gls{acr:sdn} was a key development in enabling this fine-grained routing over traffic at various layers in the protocol stack, allowing operators to offer per-flow or per-class routing for improved performance---\gls{acr:te}---or even application-aware load balancers at the switch level.
Initial forays into \gls{acr:sdn} were built on the exploiting a separate \emph{control plane}, which would install \glspl{acr:mat} on target switches---mapping fields of predefined protocols to predefined actions---leaving truly complex decisions to one or more controller machines.
These developments have been pushed even further as the runtime capabilities of supporting devices have evolved into what we might now consider truly \glsxtrfullpl{acr:pdp}.
A wide variety of \glspl{acr:asic}-based switches, SmartNICs, and other accelerators now offer an environment for truly arbitrary network logic, protocol parsers, and action definitions.

Despite all this, our general-purpose Internet remains much the same from an endpoint perspective, performance and reliability increases aside.
Yet this increase in capabilities has revealed new strands of research in more specialised networks such as those in datacentres, where in-controller processing would have allowed the network fabric to \emph{cooperate} with its hosted applications but presented an obvious computational bottleneck.
\emph{In-network compute} is enabled by such bespoke routing environments such as theirs when combined with the above advances in programmability.
In-network compute is founded on the growing idea that in-path network elements such as switches, \glspl{acr:nic}s, and middleboxes can and should act as the site of complex logic to accelerate applications, participate in flow control, or to aid in network management.

There is, of course, vast scope for their interaction. ?? describe

\subsection{Active Networking}\label{sec:active-networking}
In response to the expanding scale and widespread reach of the Internet (and computer networks in general), researchers in the early-to-mid '90s increasingly desired the tools to extend, innovate, and research routing and transport protocols.
To maintain and safeguard interoperability over the Internet, the \gls{acr:ietf} formed to maintain and oversee the development of Internet protocols for all levels of the networking stack.
The weight of full \gls{acr:ietf} standardisation was seen by many researchers of the period as a lengthy process, which they believed to be the cause of \emph{network ossification}---the Internet becoming inflexible to the design and deployment of new protocols.\sidenote{Authors of this period might be horrified to discover that the \gls{acr:ietf}'s median time to standard publication has more than doubled since 2000~\parencite{DBLP:conf/imc/McQuistinKKPTPH21}. This is not, however, what we understand as ossification in today's Internet, which I'll discuss shortly.}

\emph{Active networking} was researchers' response: a family of clean-slate proposals built around enabling switches to perform arbitrary computations on carried packets, and for the network to share resources such as compute and memory with users and applications~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/TennenhouseW96,DBLP:journals/ccr/Calvert06}.
This is a more communistic, cooperative view of the role of the network---that it should provide and manage advanced services as a sort of common good beyond raw forwarding capacity and functionality, more than simply `best-effort'.
%Shared resources, expectation of the network to `do something'.
This would enable not only new protocols empowered by the cooperation of the routing fabric, its proponents argued, but would also simplify network management and measurement; it was in no uncertain terms a radical departure for its time, standing in stark opposition to the simplicity demanded by the end-to-end protocol.
Active networks planned to enable cacheing and \gls{acr:cdn}-like behaviour, stream compression, network management, and telemetry.

Surveys of today divide the ideas of this movement into two main streams of research~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/FeamsterRZ14}:
\begin{description}
	\item[Capsules,] which consisted of compact programs bundled inside of network packets; either at a per-packet level, or installed on a per-flow basis during the handshake process.
	\item[Programmable switches,] which allowed arbitrary programs to be installed by system administrators to their own infrastructure for dataplane processing.
\end{description}
These are two key tools rather than opposing schools---and works we'll examine from tail end of the \emph{active networks} movement feature a high degree of interplay of both ideas.
It must be said that in the absence of specialist supporting hardware, the vast majority of works in this field relied entirely upon execution of high-level code via commodity host machines.
\gls{acr:udp} tunnelling and overlay networks like \emph{PlanetLab}\sidenote{PlanetLab also had a wider effect on distributed systems research. Sadly, it was shutdown in May of 2020~\parencite{planetlab-rip}.}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/ChunCRBPWB03} were necessary to do so; the former modelling a cooperative multi-\gls{acr:as} Internet in a testbed setting, and the latter providing hosts with \gls{acr:cpu} and memory slices across the world in a ticketed, quid-pro-quo manner.

\paragraph{Innovations in capsules}
\emph{ANTS}~\parencite{ANTS,DBLP:conf/dance/Wetherall02} captured the (almost stereotypical) active networking idea of `arbitrary user programs' selected by each packet.
A capsule contains one or more program IDs in each header's packet, to be inspected by an ANTS runtime at on-path active nodes.
Capsules include dataplane programming and routing logic, kept immutable between flows.
An active node checks its local cache for program code matching a capsule's IDs, which may be pre-installed by an administrator (out-of-band); on a cache miss, the code is requested from the last active node (in-band).
Programs for a given ID are verified and signed externally by some trusted organisation e.g., the \gls{acr:ietf}, but their use is still controlled by \emph{the user or endpoint application}.
%?? in-band and out-of-band installation: pre-install or request prog from prior hop on miss.
ANTS relied on the transfer of Java code: extensions such as \emph{PAN}~\parencite{PAN-activenet} investigated the use of raw unsafe x86 assembly for, e.g., in-kernel use.

\emph{Smart packets}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/tocs/SchwartzJSZRP00} examined dataplane programming from the perspective of measurement and control.
Intended as a means for management centres to install packet programs on managed nodes, one or more initialisation packets would be sent across the network between a source and destination---each containing a single complete program and all relevant authentication certificates.
Any nodes along the path---including endpoints---would be free to install or pass on logic as required.
Programs were limited, stateless, compact programs executed in a \gls{acr:vm} for all carried packets, with dedicated intrinsics for accessing state from the \gls{acr:mib}; packets could trigger \gls{acr:mib} events, or modify a packet to include per-path telemetry supporting passive and active measurement use cases.
Hosts and switches were expected to enforce limits on execution time and dynamic memory use.

\emph{NetScript}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/jsac/SilvaYF01} allows for the definition of active network programs as a dynamic (i.e., potentially branching) dataflow graph of smaller programs---\emph{boxes}.
Such boxes may be recursively defined.
Crucially, its main advantage over the similar \emph{Click}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sosp/MorrisKJK99} is that any box can be a remote node (another machine, or a specialised hardware/\gls{acr:asic} implementation), which makes this a remarkably prescient combination of control plane and dataplane programmability.
Dataplane program definition and selection is left entirely to network operators in this abstraction, however.

\paragraph{Switch programmability}
Though conceptually purer uses of programmable switches are rarer, their use is often implicitly assumed to be necessary in any real, performant active network.
The \emph{SwitchWare} project~\parencite{DBLP:journals/network/AlexanderAHKKMG98}, while very much a capsule-based proposal, primarily suggested a base of \emph{SANE}-backed switches~\parencite{DBLP:journals/network/AlexanderAKS98} which would implement a fixed, performant set of `active extensions' analogous to \gls{acr:os} syscalls.
Ahead-of-time fixed subprograms like these were key here to achieve performance and security---mainly by limiting capsule program capabilities and allowing delegation to, e.g., \gls{acr:asic} accelerated operations.

From a more practical perspective, \Textcite{DBLP:journals/jsac/WolfT01} examine the design requirements of a programmable switch in contrast with emerging \glspl{acr:npu} of the time.
They propose a \gls{acr:soc} design built around a large array of general-purpose \gls{acr:risc} \glspl{acr:cpu}, each having their own cache and memory.
A first stage \gls{acr:asic} would route packets to an output port over a shared interconnect, where these \glspl{acr:cpu} would either count as their own port or be attached to a physical egress and conditionally used.\sidenote{Curiously, this design more closely matches modern SmartNIC devices, while today's programmable switches favour \gls{acr:asic} designs. We'll return to this point in \cref{sec:modern-pdps}.}
The inclusion of complete \gls{acr:risc} \glspl{acr:cpu} is quite deliberate: early \glspl{acr:npu} such as the Intel IXP1200~\parencite{intel-ixp} and Lucent's Fast Packet Processor~\parencite{lucent-fpp} had unusual instruction sets suited to stateless processing of headers~\parencite{DBLP:conf/pldi/GeorgeB03}, limiting their general expressiveness.
A fuller \gls{acr:isa} was recognised as being necessary for more capable, general, useful, and stateful dataplane programming; particularly of the kind envisioned by active networking.

%, which is where perf-router cite succeeds. ?? stateless etc.

%?? mention smartpackets's exec model here.

Returning to \emph{smart packets}, we see a similarly earnest attempt to reconcile capsule networks with a reasonable, programming framework (as opposed to its peers' focus on high-level languages).
Aiming to be more amenable to switches they propose \emph{spanner}, a compact \gls{acr:cisc} assembly language for a stack-based \gls{acr:vm} with primitives to access the \gls{acr:mib}, compiled to by their own higher-level language.
Spanner was designed to be reasonably implemented on hosts and routers, but explicitly trades performance for compactness, focusing on small, self-contained, stateless and secure programs.\sidenote{This shares many conceptual similarities to \gls{acr:ebpf}, a \gls{acr:risc} register machine, which now plays a key role in network compute offload and \gls{acr:os} kernel extensibility. The \gls{acr:vm} abstraction, using intrinsics and maps to communicate with the environment, ensures security while the language's simplicity allows implementation in the network fabric.}
The executing switch or host enforces memory and execution limits at runtime, but single-packet $\mathcal{O}(\text{\qty{1}{\kibi\byte}})$ programs simplifies deployment logic.
Naturally, this excludes stateful boosters of the type we've examined, but is well-suited to the measurement and management use cases its authors intended.

%?? Tie into PDP here: active networking and TPP . Think about the concept of protocol boosters~\parencite{DBLP:journals/jsac/FeldmeierMSBMR98}. (NOT READ)

\paragraph{Failings and drawbacks}
Sadly, the active networking paradigm failed to properly fledge, at least in its first iteration.
It might be argued that the `communistic' network view played a key part in this downfall---that the tangled web of \glspl{acr:as} between any two nodes should freely offer compute resources to the benefit hosts.
This comes down to a simple question of economics: who pays whom for providing these services?
It's easy to reason about this in campus or internal networks (the organisation provides active capabilities as part of its own remit), or if we require that only our \gls{acr:isp} offers these capabilities (hosts pay for them explicitly).
Extending this notion to the wider Internet becomes more challenging.
Assigning responsibility for administrative, technical, and security issues among all the organisations between two endpoints is a daunting prospect, to say the least.
When modifying packets in a protocol booster-like model, it becomes difficult to communicate where boundaries of support start and end to enable truly transparent behaviour.
In a setup like the PlanetLab overlay network the incentives for providing these capabilities in such a distributed way are obvious: all the users are researchers in need of distributed network compute.
Each benefits from donating compute and network slices in their own infrastructure to receive resources in kind.

The problem here is also one of aggregation.
At the Internet core such as in \glspl{acr:ixp}, transit bandwidth demands are the sum of all connected \glspl{acr:as}, amplifying compute demands and scale concerns.
From another angle, suppose that all functions benefit the network \emph{and} hosts alike, as in the case of an in-band \gls{acr:tcp} compressor.
Here, files can be transmitted between end hosts quicker \emph{and} the bandwidth impact on the switching fabric is reduced.
If hosts benefit and have the resources to implement this functionality it is inevitable that at some point they will do so (pushing logic to the network edge), at which point network operators are able to put their own resources into faster or higher-capacity passive infrastructure with a vastly reduced attack surface compared to an active solution. 
On the upside, this also preserves the end-to-end principle.

% is part of its downfall administrative, tech, security issues etc. Even though some use cases would have benefited admins (i.e. compression to expand capacity).
%?? Obvious in PlanetLab: incentives are all users are researchers!
%?? Lots of economic drivers: who pays whom for providing these services? Why not just push this logic to hosts (preserving end-to-end) if the logic (i.e. compression) benefits the network AND hosts too?

%?? More issues? complexity, where boundaries of support start and end (and how to communicate them) (for instance, in protocol boosters).
%?? Flow migration and redundant failover, and path aggregation far harder?
%?? In ANTS, implications for flow buffering on prog miss.

Active network capabilities do in many senses \emph{limit} how networks can benefit their users (or at least make some innovations substantially harder).
Consider flow migration, potentially as part of a wider \gls{acr:te} strategy, or path aggregation to increase bisectional bandwidth or provide redundancy to protect from link failures.
Administrators must not only handle routing and design of such capabilities, but they must also ensure that active network programs on any flow's path are mirrored or migrated to the new path.
In the event of a complete or partial node failure, this may not be trivially possible.
Even when retrieving programs from the last hop, failover may be needed for a live high-bandwidth flow, requiring costly per-flow buffering at a node until capsule program setup is complete.

The capabilities of programmable network hardware were, to some extent, overshadowed by the community's focus on the more intoxicating idea of capsule networking.
Naturally, the overwhelming majority of these platform were prototyped on host machines, which limited forwarding and processing performance far below that of even the reduced Ethernet line-rate of their time.
The repeated emphasis on high-level prototypes reduced the focus on the sorts of low-level, capable languages a performant system would require---proposals were instead marred by in-vogue high-level \gls{acr:vm}-based languages such as Java and Caml, which didn't do credibility any good.
This likely added to industry scepticism---one gets the sense of a paradigm driven by research trends instead of limiting its own boundaries to produce something truly capable and scalable.

\subsection{Software-defined Networking}
In parallel, a good many researchers saw a need to innovate (and fight stagnation in) the space of what we now understand as control plane programmability: the ability to deploy and develop new routing protocols, provide bespoke routing for individual packets, flows and applications, and to adapt to changes in the network itself.
While likely starting out from the same perspective as active networking---enabling new capabilities and development, and network evolution---as years have gone by greater network capacities, usage demands and a need for far greater reliability have introduced challenges manyfold.
Greater capacities, particularly in bisection bandwidth, typically mean more equipment for network admins to manage through routers and switches, but also in terms of additional cabling for link redundancy and aggregation---neither of which play well with older spanning tree protocols.
\glsxtrfull{acr:te}---making effective use of this capacity and providing different traffic classes with optimal forwarding---has similarly become more and more important over time.
The problem is that classical routing protocols such as \gls{acr:ospf} and \gls{acr:rip} are designed for distributed autonomy, offering no support for direct routing rule insertion by administrators.
Early \gls{acr:te} approaches were thus built on a shaky foundation of hacks and tricks, exploiting routing protocol behaviour to achieve the desired high-level outcomes~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/FeamsterRZ14}.
Naturally, such workarounds become untenable and impossible to reason about at scale---particularly as failures and misconfigurations creep in and become harder to find and diagnose.
Effective though these early forays were, they remained hamstrung by the tightly coupled control and data planes of the network hardware of that era.
The reality and urgency of this problem space has led to the true separation of forwarding elements (the dataplane) from the logical control elements which inform and orchestrate their routing behaviour (the control plane).
This separation has enabled \glsxtrfull{acr:sdn}---the use of arbitrary machines and logic to define the forwarding behaviour of each and every network element~\parencite{DBLP:journals/comsur/NunesMNOT14,DBLP:journals/ccr/FeamsterRZ14}.
As we shall discuss, this has brought forth a well-developed and successful bevy of innovations in network control and design.

\paragraph{Development of the control plane}
This line of work began in earnest with the \emph{open signalling} movement~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/CampbellKMV99} in \gls{acr:atm} networks, circa 1995, which aimed to standardise the \glspl{acr:api} and protocols for passing routing protocol data to its relevant handler (and rules back to line-cards)---in an era where these elements were still tightly bonded in commercial routing hardware.
\emph{Tempest}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/network/MerweRLC98} marked its zenith, using these capabilities in tandem with specific functions of these now-obsolete \gls{acr:atm} networks to define a `network control architecture' which would oversee correct forwarding policies and resource allocation.
Its primary focus, however, was in providing independent virtual network slices---\emph{switchlets}---to users of multi-tenant networks on demand, allowing these users to pass in their own control programs written for host execution in Java, for instance.
Control plane traffic from control elements to the dataplane was carried \emph{in-band} at this time (i.e., using the same fabric as tenants' datagrams).

%?? What do I want to cover? first: separation of ctl plane, OF and Net OSes (ONOS, OpenDaylight, ...), then bring around to vNFs etc
%
%Tempest~\parencite{DBLP:journals/network/MerweRLC98} for ATM networks, built on principle of \emph{open signalling}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/CampbellKMV99} (in ATM) from 1995. IP/Ethernet networks still `bonded' FEs and CEs in routing design.
%
%?? Greater capacity and use forced focus on \gls{acr:te}, which was onerous and required insane workarounds w/ fixed-fn hardware~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/FeamsterRZ14}

These ideas were refined into general standardisation for hardware elements along a shared bus via \emph{ForCES}~\parencite{rfc3746}; stripped, of course, of the more visionary aspects such as network slicing, arbitrary control code, and wider resource management.
Primarily, this was focussed on registration of control plane elements, including key provisions for extensibility and discoverability to announce additional protocols and offer redundancy.
The move to physically remote control elements was proposed by \emph{SoftRouter}~\parencite{lakshman2004the}, such that forwarding and control elements would communicate with one another in-band over the same network they define (after a simple spanning-tree bootstrap phase) using custom discoverability protocols.
In particular this allowed its authors to experiment with reducing the number of control elements in a network, from which they observed faster convergence of protocols such as \gls{acr:ospf}.
Hardware capabilities did not at this point allow this level of control, and as such host-based routers like \emph{XORP}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/HandleyHK03} (dataplane in kernel, control plane in user space) and simulators such as \emph{ns} reigned in research at this time.

While most of the above work focusses on the \emph{intra}-domain case---routing \emph{within} an \gls{acr:as}---RCP~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/CaesarCFRSM05,10.1145/1016707.1016709} was instead motivated by how \emph{inter}-domain routing \emph{between} \glspl{acr:as} might benefit from the sorts of centralised control we now associate with \gls{acr:sdn}.
The problem in this instance is that edge routers must understand and implement \gls{acr:bgp}, each having their own arcane policies to achieve the intended network behaviour with respect to quirks of the protocol, their own hardware, and in the routes forwarded by neighbouring \glspl{acr:as}.
Their solution was to centralise this logic into one (or a few) host machines, providing a drop-in solution which could act on \emph{all} gathered \gls{acr:bgp} information to produce optimal decisions with better scaling characteristics, reduce administrative overhead and fragility, and which opened the door to later extension if neighbour \glspl{acr:as} also deployed RCP.

With the growing need for \gls{acr:te} and \gls{acr:to} at various layers of the Internet infrastructure, we begin to see a drive for wider coordination in the intra-domain case.
\emph{PCE}~\parencite{rfc4655} is one of the first serious attempts to formalise a network architecture where the control plane can calculate and install bespoke \emph{paths} at the flow level, given any set of constraints.
Naturally, this requires far greater coordination of the individual forwarding behaviour of switches, preferably combined with \gls{acr:mpls}.
\emph{Ethane}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/CasadoFPLMS07} pushed this notion of complete network control further; a dedicated controller overseeing the forwarding rules and paths installed at an entire network of `dumb' switches, containing \emph{only} an action table of \emph{exact} matches.
Their goal was not one of performant \gls{acr:te}, however, but of policy---complete control over interactions between named entities and their classes, with all flow misses being directed to the controller.\sidenote{It's worth noting that this proposal was intended only for campus networks, hence its obvious scalability limits don't bite quite as badly as they might in, say, an \gls{acr:ixp} or datacentre. In particular, it must upcall to the controller for every new address, and maintain an exact match rule for every live flow due to the lack of longest-prefix matches.}
The controller then authenticates, authorises and orchestrates all host-to-host connections according to a given policy.

The arrival of \emph{OpenFlow}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/McKeownABPPRST08} marked a watershed moment in \gls{acr:sdn}, iterating on Ethane's key ideas to remove notions of authentication, focussing more on the network itself.
Motivated to lower the barrier of entry for experimentation and research in the routing domain,\sidenote{In-text, this is again referred to as ossification: here arising from the closed nature of routing hardware coupled with the performance needs of realistic traffic.} OpenFlow decided to change tack compared with XORP and its contemporaries by targeting real hardware (and by tailoring its design to capabilities of commodity devices of the day).
OpenFlow kept Ethane's \gls{acr:mat} abstraction, as switches of that era stored flow tables internally, and required support for few actions: forward packets on a port, drop packets, encapsulate and send a packet to a delegated controller, or defer to the switch's underlying forwarding logic.
Each OpenFlow switch then maintains a dedicated, secure connection to at least one controller, though may receive rule insertion from any number.
This was set apart from its earlier competitors and progenitors by the concerted effort to ensure easy compatibility with commodity hardware, for instance by providing their own open source OpenWRT firmware.
What it then provided was an open, consistent manner for software to configure the routing behaviour of real hardware at the whim of operators, going so far as to suggest that high-performance dataplane programmability might be enabled via steering to NetFPGA devices elsewhere in the network---eliminating virtualisation.
The supported capabilities and reach have expanded somewhat since it's initial, academic and limited introduction.
Indeed, while we now understand that OpenFlow has incredible value in the operation and management of large networks, the vision embodied by the original work is in fact much closer to the `switchlet' model of Tempest where individuals request transit for traffic between their machines, carrying their experimental protocols or enacting their novel policies.
The specification has thus evolved over time to include features more useful and tailored to complex networks and costlier hardware: conditional support for more expressive actions and matching capabilities, including additional tables, groups, egress processing, and packet header modification~\parencite{openflow-1-5}.

\paragraph{An ongoing legacy}
The remarkable thing about the field of \gls{acr:sdn}, particularly compared to active networks, is that it's still here.
Moreso than that, it plays a large role in modern networks of hypergiant scale. 
We'll discuss a case study shortly.
%Why has this worked so much more effectively?
Why has control plane programmability proven to be so much more effective and attractive to operators in practice?

Principally, it is because control plane programming is easier to get right---in the sense of processing speed and volume.
Routing information, link states, and topology structure changes collectively arrive at a far slower rate than packets, or even simply carried flows.
An OpenFlow controller is under no obligation or need to, say, react to millions of routing changes per second while adding only microseconds of latency, because the routing \emph{environment} varies at a rate to which is well suited to the processing capabilities of commodity hosts.

Secondly, the wide reach of open-source software for developing, deploying, and testing \gls{acr:sdn} concepts and ideas has helped these ideas gain traction in both the research community and in real-world deployment.
Network \glspl{acr:os} and controllers such as  \emph{NOX}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/GudeKPPCMS08}, \emph{Onix}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/KoponenCGSPZRIIHS10}, \emph{ONOS}~\parencite{onos}, \emph{OpenDaylight}~\parencite{opendaylight}, and \emph{Ryu}~\parencite{ryu} provide moderately easy interfaces for programmers to implement their own controllers.
Network emulators such as \emph{mininet}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/LantzHM10} allow researchers to define and operate virtual networks built entirely of OpenFlow-capable switches on their own machines using host programs and standard sockets to generate and use carried traffic, enabling easy prototyping.
High-performance software switches such as \gls{acr:ovs}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/PfaffPKJZRGWSSA15} offer first-class support for OpenFlow and no small number of extensions, and are instrumental in datacentre virtualisation~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/TuWAP21}.

%?? Why the success? iterative, built on existing tech with an easier-to-use interface etc.
Finally, the movement capitalised on \emph{existing hardware} and its own capabilities, rather than calling for a radical wave of enhancements or brand new, expensive capabilities.
Providing a higher-level abstraction to manage the infrastructure which networks already contained ensured the adoption and current success of \gls{acr:sdn}.

%?? A survey to mine for stuff~\parencite{DBLP:journals/comsur/NunesMNOT14}

One well-documented, well-published, and arguably ongoing case study of this paradigm in action at scale is the wave of high-impact papers produced by Google.
Google's \emph{Jupiter} datacentre network design~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SinghOAAABBDFGK15} was developed concurrently with most of the works outlined above, where these techniques have been instrumental in managing the explosive uptick in switch hardware demanded by their larger Clos topologies.\sidenote{Particular issues demanding custom routing and administration include the vast amount of multipath complexity at this scale, heavy per-link state, and potential performance gains from network homogeneity that general-purpose routing algorithms might fail to capture.}
Additionally, \gls{acr:sdn} techniques have helped to manage phased integration of this new network.
In \gls{acr:wan} topologies, \emph{B4}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/JainKMOPSVWZZZHSV13} has made direct use of OpenFlow for \gls{acr:te}, to maximise link utilisation and offer resilience (aided by the fact that Google own the \gls{acr:wan} endpoints, too).
The architecture evolved fairly cleanly over the following 5 years, coping with \qty{100}{\times} bandwidth increases and more stringent reliability bounds~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/HongMAZABBJKLMP18}.
\emph{Espresso}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/YapMRPHBHKNJLRR17} extends this to inter-domain peering arrangements with the Internet and \gls{acr:bgp} session management, finally realising the vision of RCP 13 years on.
Nowadays, datacentre and \gls{acr:wan} networks are managed by a single higher-level microservice \gls{acr:sdn} architecture, \emph{Orion}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/FergusonGHKMMOP21}.

\section{Modern Programmable Dataplanes}\label{sec:modern-pdps}
While active network research may have dried up in the last 20 years,\sidenote{Barring some very obvious throwback works such as \emph{Tiny Packet Programs}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/JeyakumarAGKM14}.} interest in dataplane processing has remained strong.
Network operators have, in fact, always had a need for complex packet processing, to measure, protect, and enhance \emph{their own} networks---rather than to provide the sort of communal good envisioned by active networks.
To run through some examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Firewalls} are a necessity for filtering unauthorised traffic at stub \glspl{acr:as}, but require line-rate lookups versus large allow- and block-lists across varied protocols.
	\item Protocol enhancements and \gls{acr:te} solutions, such as \emph{\gls{acr:wan} optimisers} and \emph{application-layer load balancers}, which need to be able to inspect and/or modify traffic based on (possibly complex) transport-layer and application-layer semantics.
	\item Security functions, such as \glspl{acr:ids} and \gls{acr:ddos} traffic scrubbing solutions. These can require complex, stateful logic (such as regular expression matching and transparent datagram reassembly) that makes them challenging to implement at high performance---particularly when we consider that the \gls{acr:ddos} use case \emph{demands} that we keep up with a high ingress traffic volume.
\end{itemize}
At scale, the performance challenges involved in per-packet and per-flow processing for these functions becomes difficult to reconcile with the performance limitations of host machines.
The obvious solution is to fall back to silicon in pursuit of performance, and as a result the market has long included so-called \emph{middleboxes}---bespoke \gls{acr:asic} devices designed to perform one or more pre-defined dataplane functions at line rate.

An obvious trade-off has been made here: runtime programmability has been sacrificed for performance.
What is less obvious is that another, hidden, cost has been introduced owing to the fallibility of engineers---our final source of network ossification.
While effective at their designed tasks, middleboxes are infamous for relying on the \emph{observed} behaviour of network traffic rather than the behaviours actually decreed in the relevant \gls{acr:ietf} standards and specifications.
As a result, they have become a barrier to the wider deployment and introduction of protocols in the Internet.
\gls{acr:sctp}~\parencite{rfc4960} is one recent example of an approved protocol whose deployment has been hobbled by the prevalence of middleboxes that expect only a limited suite of layer-4 protocols~\parencite{sctp-middlebox-bad}.
Under the same considerations, the \emph{QUIC} transport protocol~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/LangleyRWVKZYKS17} must be tunnelled over \gls{acr:udp}, even though its Internet-wide deployment is backed by the weight of hypergiant provider Google.

%?? issues w/ their config and integration from an operational perspective
These devices also introduce operational and logistical challenges around their configuration and installation within the network.
%?? Initially, full-on rerouting.
Although \gls{acr:sdn}-based steering has to some extent obviated the need to physically rewire middleboxes' cabling when they need to be reconfigured, they do still present challenges beyond the above network fragility.
%?? Now SDN can help simplify
%?? Still issues with placement, lock-in, reconfig'ability...
Specialised middleboxes are expensive, demand rack space and introduce their own power and cooling demands, making deployment harder to scale out as network traffic demands increase.
They are failure-prone, require specialist knowledge to operate, and are vulnerable to vendor lock-in~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SherryHSKRS12}.
Moreover, their fixed nature makes them difficult to modify, upgrade, and fix; a sunk cost which cannot be recouped or repurposed as network function requirements change or evolve.

%?? Ossification in today's sense? Middleboxes? i.e. barrier to wider deployment even after standardisation i.e. hobbled SCTP~\parencite{rfc4960}, forced QUIC onto UDP. Also, middleboxes expensive and require work to integrate.\sidenote{Ossification causes: weight of \gls{acr:ietf}, desire for perf causing hardware impls (inflexible), over-reliance on observed behaviours of network \& protocols rather than the specs.}

The result of these drawbacks is that a constant desire has remained to introduce and capitalise on true dataplane programmability.
%?? Probably two streams: capable hardware (and its programming), and making host-based solns faster.
The pursuit of this goal can be divided quite neatly into two streams.
The first carries on from the use of virtualisation common in active networking research before the introduction of a true programmable dataplane fabric, towards more flexible deployment through \gls{acr:nfv} and \glspl{acr:vnf}.
The second stream instead follows from asking how we might make switching and forwarding hardware itself more programmable, keeping in the tight form-factor and performance bounds required of high-speed commercial network hardware.

\subsection{Virtualisation and Commodity Machines}
Commodity \glspl{acr:cpu} are already arbitrarily programmable yet their dataplane performance has always been at odds with ever-improving Ethernet standards, leading researchers to ask: how can we alleviate the existing performance bottlenecks in host dataplanes?
How can we take further advantage of the advantages of host machines to allow for multitenancy and make runtime reconfiguration even easier by leaning into the ubiquity of host compute?
Backed by \gls{acr:sdn} and by innovations in \gls{acr:vm} and container research from the systems community, \glspl{acr:vnf} and similar frameworks have filled a comfortable niche for moderately performant host dataplane programming.

\gls{acr:nfv} and \glspl{acr:vnf} envisioned that \glspl{acr:nf} should be implemented as commodity software programs running within \glspl{acr:vm}, allowing not only the above increases in asset reuse and programmability but also allowing for hardware hetereogeneity, portability of developed functions, and resilience~\parencite{etsi-nfv}.
Casting dataplane programming in this light has its fair share of advantages.
%?? strengths: can always scale out by addming more machines, easy to program, ...
Administrators can always scale horizontally to meet traffic processing demands by acquiring more commodity host machines, and the dataplane functions themselves are easy to program for typical software engineers.
%?? software: can run commercial software like Snort~\parencite{DBLP:conf/lisa/Roesch99,SnortManual} or Zeek~\parencite{zeek,DBLP:conf/uss/Paxson98}
Bespoke development is not required either; \glspl{acr:vm} may easily run openly available, widely used \gls{acr:ids} software like Snort~\parencite{DBLP:conf/lisa/Roesch99,SnortManual} or Zeek~\parencite{zeek,DBLP:conf/uss/Paxson98} with minimal effort.
Moreover, \gls{acr:vnf} setup requires on the order of minutes or less, and \gls{acr:vnf} execution can be dynamically stopped, restart, or moved around; capitalising on the strengths of virtualisation~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/MartinsAROHBH14,DBLP:conf/iscc/CzivaJWP15}.
The \gls{acr:vm} model then allows for easy multi-tenancy and resource sharing, governed by a hypervisor \emph{\`{a} la} \emph{Xen}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sosp/BarhamDFHHHN03} or \emph{KVM}~\parencite{kvm}.

Naturally, more widespread adoption of container frameworks\sidenote{\emph{Containers} are a form of \gls{acr:os}-level virtualisation, with a history reaching back to \emph{FreeBSD Jails}~\parencite{jails}. This is a lighter-weight alternative to full \glspl{acr:vm}, having a single shared \gls{acr:os} which provides filesystem isolation and virtualises access to I/O devices. While isolation guarantees are weaker around \gls{acr:nf} performance, this does enable some runtime benefits, such as fast container-container network communication on the same node.} has percolated into the design of \gls{acr:vnf} deployment strategies.
Container \gls{acr:vnf} solutions based on \emph{Docker}~\parencite{docker} and \emph{Kubernetes}~\parencite{k8s}, such as \emph{GNF}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/iscc/CzivaJWP15,DBLP:journals/cm/CzivaP17}, have taken advantage of the lightweight virtualisation to offer marked improvements in traffic processing latency and throughput over their priors.
Their reconfigurability, combined with clever use of network resources empowered by \gls{acr:sdn}, has also opened the door for \emph{orchestration} research which maximises \gls{acr:vnf} performance subject to environmental limits.
%Orchestration, clever use of network resources empowered by \gls{acr:sdn}
\glspl{acr:vnf} and the steering between them may be optimised ahead-of-time (or live) to protect users' application latency or \gls{acr:qos}, by \glspl{acr:ilp}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/infocom/CzivaAP18}, heuristics~\parencite{DBLP:conf/im/Iordache-SicaAP21}, or data-driven methods~\parencite{DBLP:conf/netsoft/RieraBBDMPLGPCP16}.

%?? Cite concrete frameworks -- click NF etc., ETSI standards.

%?? Contrast clicky vs Container-y vs Xen~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sosp/BarhamDFHHHN03} style VMs.

%--- CLICKY ---

While the above works relate mainly to the higher-level composition and interconnection of network functions, a long lineage of works drawn from \emph{Click}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sosp/MorrisKJK99} have instead focussed on how to build these packet programs from smaller chunks for efficient processing and easier development in the \gls{acr:nfv} framework.
Click itself views the dataplane as a configurable graph of interconnected, predefined building blocks which are then composed together into a single, pipelined program.
\emph{ClickOS}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/MartinsAROHBH14} introduces a micro-\gls{acr:os} designed only to run Click programs as part of a Xen hypervisor stack, achieving substantial packet rate and spool-up time improvements, while \emph{Fastclick}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/ancs/BarbetteSM15} innovates in performance by migrating Click on standard Linux hosts to use Intel's \gls{acr:dpdk}.
\emph{ClickNF}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/GalloL18} then introduces support for higher-level stateful protocols such as the \gls{acr:tcp} stack, enabling \gls{acr:http} caches and proxies as network functions.
\emph{NetBricks}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/PandaHJWRS16} maintains the directed graph model and \gls{acr:dpdk} support, however it takes user-generated functions rather than full, pre-specified blocks, and relies upon the \emph{Rust}~\parencite{rust} language compiler to enforce of memory and packet data accesses.
\emph{OpenBox}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/Bremler-BarrHH16} makes use of a similar framework of smaller configurable processing blocks, though its main focus lies in fusing \gls{acr:nf} components in larger chains across several machines.
When functions are co-hosted on any machine, OpenBox merges their processing graphs to deduplicate more expensive operations (reducing processing latency) while allowing some degree of metadata transfer between hardware-optimised processing and commodity hosts.

We have also seen specialisation of these frameworks to account for security at varied levels, due to the importance of security functions such as \glspl{acr:ids} and the proliferation of \gls{acr:vnf} chains deployed to remote cloud compute.
For instance, \gls{acr:vnf} operation must be protected from other \glspl{acr:vnf} and the host machine it runs in (which may be compromised), as must packet data and proprietary \gls{acr:vnf} source code.
\emph{SafeBricks}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/PoddarLPR18} extends the prior NetBricks to take advantage of \glspl{acr:tee}.\sidenote{\glspl{acr:tee} allow secure execution of code on a target machine to be isolated from wither the kernel, typically by using encrypted memory pages accessible only to the \gls{acr:cpu}. Platforms such as Intel SGX also include provisions for binary and machine attestation.}
%The main framework goals above the benefits of TEEs themselves are to protect traffic from the NF (i.e., inappropriate field/packet accesses) and protect NF source code from the framework.
%The execution model is a directed graph of smaller user functions including branches etc., where each NF is given access to specific packet regions by a framework (attaching a permission set to each sub-NF at build time).
This executes as a single binary in the \gls{acr:tee} with another thread running in userland to operate \gls{acr:dpdk} as a dedicated packet relay, due to the prohibitive cost of swaps in or out of the trusted enclave from complete cache flushes, re-encryption, and so on.
%DPDK daemon in userland passes packets in (i.e., Scone below)---one executing pipeline (though surely could be multiple in theory?).
%NF source code (and any pre-encrypted proprietary NF source codes) are given to \emph{trusted binary} which includes all details and attested in the same manner as the compiled program.
\emph{AuditBox} adds verified routing protocols to this~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/LiuSKPSS21}, enabling packet routing \emph{between enclaved \gls{acr:vnf} chains} on separate machines---ensuring also that packet paths are obeyed, and that the network is not altering or reordering packets.
Additionally, this allows path auditing in a way which is invisible to \glspl{acr:vnf} and the network.
%Versus prior VRPs, this enables dynamic routing between NF segments (i.e., selective filtering to a lighter or heavier function based on local state).
%Note that you can do this \emph{in one box} using SafeBricks, the novelty here pertains to adaptively routing \emph{between several boxes}.
%Cost? Halves goodput vs. NetBricks.
However, this latter solution achieves only half the packet forwarding goodput of NetBricks in exchange for these additional guarantees.

\subsection{Specialised Hardware}
Although host-run functions have indeed improved, their performance still trails unacceptably behind \glspl{acr:asic}---traffic volume can be accounted for up to a limit by horizontal scaling, but this becomes more difficult to operate than a single bump-in the wire solution, or may be impossible at larger port densities.
Programmable network hardware, beginning with early \glspl{acr:npu} and culminating in today's SmartNICs and programmable \gls{acr:asic}-backed switches, innovates on introducing runtime reconfigurable compute to these devices.

\paragraph{NIC programmability}
\glspl{acr:npu}, dedicated network cards including general-purpose processors for arbitrary packet processing, first arrived around the year 2000 as we've discussed in \cref{sec:active-networking}, with commercial designs such as the Intel IXP1200~\parencite{intel-ixp}.
These presented an early middleground between fixed-function (though performant) \glspl{acr:asic} and commodity host (virtualised) packet processing, offering line-rate performance at a smaller form and fanout factor (i.e., 1 or 2 ports).
By 2008, their architectural space was dominated by multiprocessor \gls{acr:soc}-type designs offered by a good many vendors~\parencite[p.~306]{npu-book}.\sidenote{Following up the fates of these providers paints an interesting picture of monopolisation by traditional network vendors: consider for instance Sandburst's acquisition by Broadcom~\parencite{sandburst-buyout}, or EZchip's acquisition by Mellanox~\parencite{ezchip-buyout}.}
Yet at this time there was still a high degree of microarchitectural diversity between vendors~\parencite{DBLP:conf/iccd/KeutzerMN02,npu-oos}---pipelined versus symmetric core designs, \gls{acr:vliw} and superscalar alongside one-way designs. and the presence or absence of use case-specific \glspl{acr:fu} and coprocessors.
Some constants of interest include a large, shared register file to enable zero-cost context switches and mask I/O latencies, and non-trivial programming models.
%?? lost out to \glspl{acr:asic} for the longest time because chips were cheap and fast, even if their design wasn't!~\parencite[p.~308]{npu-book}
These devices fell behind \glspl{acr:asic} in deployment and use for the longest time due to the speed and low cost of chips were cheap and fast---even if their design state was costly~\parencite[p.~308]{npu-book}---twinned with the need for deep expertise from software engineers.

\emph{SmartNICs} present the logical evolution of this low port-density form factor, offering line-rate packet processing for modern Ethernet (\qtyrange{10}{100}{\giga\bit\per\second}).
What then sets them apart is that SmartNICs optionally function as a \gls{acr:nic} compatible with common \glspl{acr:os}---supporting for instance the standard offloads such as checksumming and segmentation.
Modern day SmartNICs such as the NVIDIA/Mellanox BlueField~\parencite{nvidia-bluefield} and Netronome Agilio~\parencite{netronome-smartnic} series trace their lineage back to these \glspl{acr:npu}, to some extent realising the architecture which some past works thought programmable switches might adopt~\parencite{DBLP:journals/jsac/WolfT01}.
That is to say, large numbers of weaker \emph{general-purpose} \gls{acr:risc} \glspl{acr:cpu} which can route to one another or an output \gls{acr:mac} via a shared interconnect, with ample coprocessors (for e.g., cryptography) and resources like \gls{acr:tcam} for accelerated processing.
This contrasts the network-specific \glspl{acr:isa} used in their predecessors,\sidenote{Mellanox \glspl{acr:nic} in particular use standard ARM cores, while Netronome's offerings use a proprietary \gls{acr:isa} with full C language compatibility.} while also adding an increased focus on acting as a \gls{acr:nic} for the host machine in addition to their bump-in-the-wire capabilities.
Packet throughput requirements are met by sheer parallelism in these devices---Netronome's NFP-6480 contains \num{112} cores acting in a non-pipelined way (\cref{adx:nfp-arch})---but such SmartNICs often impose greater latency on carried packets.

However, \glspl{acr:fpga} have become more capable over time and now present a reasonable means of achieving \gls{acr:asic}-like performance (high throughput \emph{and} low latency) and runtime reconfigurability without fabrication.
The advent of the openly available NetFPGA~\parencite{DBLP:conf/mse/LockwoodMWGHNRL07} design as a platform for network processing research and teaching has been a key driver here, such that the SmartNIC market also includes \gls{acr:fpga}-backed \glspl{acr:nic} such as the Xilinx Alveo~\parencite{xilinx-alveo}.
Similarly, other vendors have produced open \gls{acr:nic} designs, such as AMD/Xilinx's \emph{OpenNIC}~\parencite{amd-opennic} platform.
NetFPGA processing speeds are also continuously improved in tandem with line rate: see NetFPGA-SUME~\parencite{DBLP:journals/micro/ZilbermanACM14} at \qty{40}{\giga\bit\per\second}, and NetFPGA-PLUS~\parencite{netfpga-plus} at \qty{100}{\giga\bit\per\second}.

%?? Talk about how SmartNICs match what we thought p-switches would be\Textcite{DBLP:journals/jsac/WolfT01}, while p-switches are now ASICs, like you promised. Why did this happen? ?? multi-core can match rates on one or two ports, but getting \qtyrange{1}{2}{\tera\bit\per\second} would need an insane amount of cores (so ASICs are the only valid way to get in some manner of programmability)---also, the exclusion of the idea of `user-given programs' ?? maybe put later.

\paragraph{Switch programmability}
Let us turn now to programmable \emph{switches}.
I should first state that the path they have taken is altogether different from what \citeauthor{DBLP:journals/jsac/WolfT01} proposed some 21 years ago.
It should be readily apparent that the designs we seen in modern SmartNICs would be broadly incompatible with high port densities (i.e., 56 ports) as the sum traffic bandwidth rises to \qtyrange{1}{2}{\tera\bit\per\second} and beyond.
Operating and connecting together hundreds or thousands of general purpose cores then requires vast amounts of power and cooling, to say nothing of the engineering challenge of designing an efficient interconnect for all these \glspl{acr:fu}.
We quickly reach a point at which \glspl{acr:asic} are the only means to achieve some manner of programmability; we must instead ask \emph{how much} freedom to give programmers, and then architect around this restricted programmability.

Serious contenders began to reach the market in 2013, such as Intel's \emph{FlexPipe}~\parencite{flexpipe-fm5000} and Cavium's \emph{XPliant}~\parencite{cavium-xpliant}---however, due to its publication and later impact we will leave these aside in favour of \gls{acr:rmt}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/BosshartGKVMIMH13}.
\gls{acr:rmt}'s motivation followed on from the design and limitations of OpenFlow, asking not only how to make \glspl{acr:mat} faster in hardware but also how a new architecture might allow for new protocols and encapsulations such as VXLAN dynamically.
To do this, the switch must offer runtime reconfiguration of field definitions and locations, the shapes of \glspl{acr:mat}, actions themselves, and control over output queue selection and disciplines.
The \gls{acr:rmt} model divides the switch into ingress and egress pipelines with a queue and buffer management element between them, with an array of configurable \gls{acr:tcam}-backed parsers to operate on the inbound packets in each pipeline.
Pipelines are subdivided into 32 stages, each having 200 action units that act in parallel on the packet header vector using a \gls{acr:vliw} instruction from a \gls{acr:mat} lookup.
Because of this, each stage can perform a single operation per field, though the control plane can make use of the large number of action units to perform speculative execution and divide and split logical stages between parts of the physical pipeline.
This design sees wide adoption today.
Barefoot---now Intel---\emph{Tofino} switches use a switching core built on this architecture, the \gls{acr:pisa}~\parencite{barefoot-pisa}.

%?? Notes on early HW designs~\parencite{DBLP:conf/iccd/KeutzerMN02,npu-oos}

%?? Very good source on \glspl{acr:npu} while \gls{acr:sdn} was getting off its feet~\parencite{npu-book}---check for history etc.

%?? Can we plot from \glspl{acr:npu}? incl., e.g., Orig NetFPGA~\parencite{DBLP:conf/mse/LockwoodMWGHNRL07}

%?? \gls{acr:rmt}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/BosshartGKVMIMH13}) arose in response to limits of conventional switches and OpenFlow---became \gls{acr:pisa}~\parencite{barefoot-pisa}?

%?? Similar time as RMT: Intel \emph{FlexPipe}~\parencite{flexpipe-fm5000}, Cavium \emph{XPliant}~\parencite{cavium-xpliant}.

The question which then remained was how the control plane, and engineers in general, should actually program these advanced classes of switching hardware to exploit these new features.
\emph{Protocol-oblivious forwarding}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/Song13} was an early proposal in this regard which failed to launch; a single `flow instruction set' would act as a common compile-time target to govern protocol parsing logic and action implementations, while even allowing in-band modification of \gls{acr:mat} entries by actions.
In retrospect, its main failing is that it overlooked how ergonomic, high-level programming should be carried out while also advocating a hardware redesign not entirely backed by a sensible implementation.
\emph{P4}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/ccr/BosshartDGIMRSTVVW14} is a language which instead targets the design of a dataplane---its table layouts, actions, and parser design---from a high, user-friendly level.
Users program parsers as a finite state machine, while table and action sets are structured as imperative programs based on the classes of match offered by a target switch---switches are supported by defining their architecture in headers and implementing a new backend for the compiler, \emph{p4c}.
Actions have access to \emph{metadata} (per-packet state) and \emph{registers} (shared dataplane state), where the latter is analogous to OpenFlow's \emph{counters}.
P4 supports many target dataplanes today:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Programmable switches, through either vendor-provided backends such as the \emph{Tofino Native Architecture} or shared targets such as the \gls{acr:psa}~\parencite{p4-psa}---a higher-level abstraction over Barefoot's \gls{acr:pisa}. \Cref{fig:p4-psa} demonstrates the \gls{acr:psa} in particular.
	\item SmartNICs, via vendor-specific compiler additions,
	\item NetFPGA cards, via the P4$\rightarrow$NetFPGA pipeline~\parencite{DBLP:conf/fpga/IbanezBMZ19},
	\item Software switches such as \emph{bmv2}~\parencite{bmv2}, \emph{PISCES}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ShahbazCPKFMR16} built on \gls{acr:ovs}, and the more performant \emph{T4P4S}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/hpsr/VorosHKLTL18} which compiles to C code with a \gls{acr:dpdk} backend.
\end{itemize}
Any device intrinsics or capabilities which cannot be expressed in P4 may be called out to using \texttt{extern} directives.
Generating compatible control plane protocols and \glspl{acr:api} is then handled by \emph{P4Runtime}~\parencite{p4-runtime}, restoring the hardware-agnostic control at the core of OpenFlow.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{diagrams/pdp-lit/p4-psa}
	\caption[Pipeline stages and forwarding paths of the P4 PSA.]{Pipeline stages and forwarding paths of the P4 \gls{acr:psa}. User programmable blocks are coloured in orange, where \gls{acr:mat} blocks comprise the `Ingress' and `Egress' stages. While an \gls{acr:rmt}-like action model is common, the \gls{acr:psa} abstracts over how actions should be implemented in any target dataplane. Instead, it specifically determines the high-level structure of ingress and egress processing---as two separate parse-\gls{acr:mat}-deparse pipelines---and how packets may be moved and cloned between these pipelines. For instance, a packet may only be cloned at the beginning of the egress pipeline, and may only repeat processing by returning to the start of ingress. Some packet processing or aggregation programs may only be expressed using workarounds in this structure.\label{fig:p4-psa}}
\end{figure}

8 years on, P4 has apparently been a runaway success in much the same vein as OpenFlow, and enjoys use in production edge networks~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/TianGLZCZDYMTLW21} while also enabling efficient and production-ready implementations of next-generation Internet designs such as \emph{SCION}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/conext/RuiterS21}.
These technologies, including SmartNICs, are also seeing use in national research and education networks---for control and network design such as G\'{e}ant's RARE project~\parencite{geant-rare-article}, and for fine-grained network telemetry and future P4-backed processing in ESnet6~\parencite{esnet6-hts,esnet6-htp}.

A more important effect of having arbitrary control over actions and manipulation of shared state is that, although limited, the set of programs we can express has grown significantly.
Although we'll discuss this in more depth in \cref{sec:offloading-and-in-network-compute}, this enables true \emph{in-network compute}---per-packet processing, e.g., in telemetry use cases like \emph{PINT}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/BasatRLAYM20} at rates and volumes hitherto impossible for hosts to achieve.
Moreover, this enables application acceleration and other new developments with none of the costs of host execution.

%T4P4S~\parencite{DBLP:conf/hpsr/VorosHKLTL18} converts P4 programs into C, which are linked against a target-specific network hardware abstraction layer.
%This seems to be the most effective host deployment for P4 at the moment, since it buys you DPDK-capable P4 dataplane installation compared to how terribly slow BMv2 is known to be.
%Slower than native DPDK, but outpaces OvS, and allows definition of HAL binaries in SmartNIC C code as needed too.

%?? Where does \emph{PISCES}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ShahbazCPKFMR16} fit into the story? It's OvS using P4 to add new features and design dataplanes. ?? This is probably an aside.

\subsection{The Return of Active Networking?}
The reader may well be thinking that research community has cycled back around to active networking in a new guise, and in many senses it has.
While less popular at the time, the programmable switch model we have latched onto did in fact arise as part of this prior movement.
The remarkable observation is that if we follow the retelling of \Textcite{DBLP:journals/ccr/FeamsterRZ14}, active networking's decline was written in large part by its lack of a ``killer app''.
Of course, its main use cases at the time were touted as enabling cacheing and \gls{acr:cdn}-like behaviour, content processing, network management, and fine-grained telemetry.
These are strikingly similar to the use cases which have driven the recent upsurge of \gls{acr:pdp} applications, and in fact see real use in production edge networks~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/TianGLZCZDYMTLW21}.
Modern measurement schemes like \emph{P4 INT}~\parencite{p4-int} have returned to the model of injecting per-packet actions into the packet headers themselves.

\Textcite{DBLP:journals/ccr/WetherallT19} also recognise this resurgence, and reaffirm the main drivers of \gls{acr:sdn}---\emph{economics} of a malleable software layer exploiting affordable commodity hardware (where talented software engineers are commonplace), and \emph{virtualisation} as a tool for introducing more capability into the network.
What they don't really discuss are the concrete reasons for why the field appears to have successfully taken off this time, while it foundered before.
So, what changed?
My personal interpretation and opinion is that this arises from several angles: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Virtualisation introduced the capability to install novel and reconfigurable packet processing to networks, but modern deployments and the constant need to `scale up' have emphasised that performance truly is a necessity. This doesn't only hark back to the logical cost involved in moving packets around the software or \gls{acr:os} stack in a machine (added latency), but also via the falloff of Moore's law~\parencite{moore-law} and Dennard scaling~\parencite{dennard-paper}. Although host capabilities have always fallen behind line-rate, they are falling even further back due to the constant, inexorable increase in Ethernet data rates.\sidenote{Of course, dedicated silicon always offers a performance edge over an arbitrary computer, at the cost of flexibility. The design, fabrication, and engineering costs are high enough that this has only ever really been justified in common use-cases (e.g., firewalls and \glspl{acr:ids}) or where there really is a business case as with modern hypergiant providers.} `Line-rate' has increased from its initial \qty{10}{\mega\bit\per\second} to \qty{1}{\giga\bit\per\second}~\parencite{gbe-standard}, to \qty{100}{\giga\bit\per\second}~\parencite{100-gbe}, with ongoing work to standardise \qty{400}{\giga\bit\per\second} links. When we consider that Ethernet frame sizes have in the same period expanded on \emph{some} deployments from \qty{1560}{\byte} to \qty{9000}{\byte} `jumbo' frames, it is plainly visible that per-packet processing deadlines simply cannot be met by commodity hosts on smaller packets.
	\item The unforeseen capabilities, reach and business needs of hypergiant network operators such as Google and Meta, pushing the boundaries of scalability~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/GigisCMNKDKS21}, have also played a key role. Crucially, their business needs include not only the administration of such large networks but also rely on accelerating cloud compute workloads, large-scale \gls{acr:ml} model training and inference, and distributed computation within their datacentre networks. As we'll cover in \cref{sec:offloading-and-in-network-compute}, in-network compute allows specific optimisations for these tasks: for instance gradient aggregation in-network, or \glspl{acr:cca} managed co-operatively by the routing infrastructure. In environments such as these where all aspects of distributed computation can be controlled and optimised, such hyper-converged infrastructure is not only possible but necessary from an economic standpoint---particularly when in-network compute becomes the only way to increase performance further. While such companies have the capability and precedent to develop their own hardware---e.g., network-connected accelerators like Microsoft BrainWave~\parencite{DBLP:conf/isca/FowersOPMLLAHAG18}---these organisations already had an abundance of engineers familiar with \gls{acr:sdn} who were poised to make great use of the joint flexibility and performance offered by \glspl{acr:pdp}.
\end{itemize}
Alternatively, we might argue that it is the control plane innovations of \gls{acr:sdn} that made this possible in the first place; beforehand, the design schism of capsules versus programmable switches was indeed an open question (one might say between `pragmatic' and `interesting' approaches to the task).
The field's re-evolution of programmable switches (and now \glspl{acr:nic}) offers a healthy does of pragmatism, ensuring that today's model is performant---but almost entirely focussed on allowing runtime reconfigurable specificity over which packets are fed to a pre-set array of dataplane programs, as opposed to totally arbitrary packet-level programs.

%?? Fit into above some mention of `obvious throwbacks' like \emph{TPP}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/JeyakumarAGKM14}

%?? Fit this in wrt. moore's law observations.
%?? How? They believed the way to make it feasible was to limit scope to management. Now we knoe this is valid, but so too is in-network compute?
Yet the model of in-network compute we have converged on remains radically different from early estimates, even though it may feel like the community is simply retreading the `programmable switches' high-level concept.
Consider the motivation behind \emph{SmartPackets}:
\begin{quotation}

\end{quotation}
At that time too, Moore's law was insufficient to allow per-packet processing at cutting-edge Ethernet speeds (before its falloff really came to pass).
As such, the only time that \emph{full, general-purpose compute} could be deployed in this context was when the infrastructure had already aggregated or reduced the data frequency in some way.
The authors here make two key, and arguably fatal, assumptions.
The first hinges on a perceived status quo: that management and telemetry data would \emph{and must} remain low-frequency (e.g., flow-level, link-level, or sampled measurements).
\Cref{sec:offloading-and-in-network-compute} shows that for many applications this cannot be the case, as per-packet processing and telemetry are essential in accelerating distinct use cases and diagnosing insidious network faults and behaviours such as microbursts.
The second is that the compute model itself should be equivalent to host machines, able to express any packet processing programs an engineer might dream of.
We see this in other programmable switch proposals of the era~\parencite{DBLP:journals/jsac/WolfT01}, but time has shown that \gls{acr:npu}-like SmartNICs of today can only achieve this for one or two ports---let alone the full fanout of a rack-mounted switch.
The first key difference lies in how, at scale, we must make use of advanced (though highly programmable) \glspl{acr:asic} rather than full-fledged \glspl{acr:cpu}.
While the design of SmartNICs allows us to dispel the first assumption and enable exciting new use cases, in the switch form factor we have come to accept \emph{constrained}, yet still capable, programmability to meet line-rate processing.
The other key difference between the modern \gls{acr:pdp} ecosystem and active networks is that the scope of deployment has narrowed considerably.
While early proponents dreamed of a fully participative network, inclusive of end-hosts' in-network programs, \gls{acr:pdp} devices must be programmed ahead-of-time and managed by an attached controller machine---both for performance and for management of the associated control-plane machinery such as \gls{acr:mat} structure.
In turn, the scope of deploying in-network compute has become far more insular, and effectively bound to the \gls{acr:as} level.
%?? Bound to the \gls{acr:as} level. Insular.

%?? What's different? Focus on ctl-plane connected, but essentially limited to individual \glspl{acr:as} in contrast to the augmented end-to-end vision of yore. Did it succeed \emph{because} it's more constrained? i.e. no inter-AS vision, not tied to preselected forwarding paths...
%
%?? Regardless, the old paradigm of active networking has been realised in the form of \glspl{acr:pdp} and in-network compute.

\subsection{Frontiers in Programmable Networks}
Commercial developments along the same lines as the modern \gls{acr:pdp} hardware covered in \cref{sec:modern-pdps} are proceeding apace as network bandwidth demands grow larger.
Intel's Tofino 2~\parencite{tofino2} represents the latest product in the lineage of \gls{acr:rmt} hardware, offering \qty{12.8}{\tera\bit\per\second} with support for \qty{400}{\giga\bit\per\second} Ethernet.
Nokia's FP5~\parencite{nokia-fp5} similarly promises full programmability for high-density switching and routing at \qty{800}{\giga\bit\per\second} Ethernet, while Intel's \emph{infrastructure processing units}~\parencite{intel-ipu} present a combined \gls{acr:fpga}- and Xeon-based series of SmartNICs for accelerating datacentre applications.
However, there is still concerted research effort in further developing the tooling used to program these devices and in how future hardware designs might evolve to incorporate new models of packet processing.

%?? Mention more recent lang and HW developments.

\paragraph{Language design}
At present, P4 and the \gls{acr:psa} are restrictive in the sense that the only events which can drive user-provided code are packet arrivals and departures.
Event-driven languages have been suggested~\parencite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/IbanezABM19}, built on the need for timer, link state, and queue state events to enable useful applications.
Workarounds in P4 exist to emulate these capabilities, such as queue size estimation and costly packet recirculations, but these inflate the amount of state needed by applications or incur their own runtime penalities.
The authors explicitly include these events into the pipeline model and modify the P4 language to support their processing by additional logical pipelines; however, this demands hardware support in non-NetFPGA environments.
%Timer events and device state changes would empower in-network RL use-cases, signalling timesteps for RL agents or new, effective, fine-grained sources of input state.
\emph{Lucid}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SonchackLRW21} builds a new, high-level language which expresses many of these capabilities by compiling down to the P4-\gls{acr:psa} architecture.
In particular, it allows for event handlers to be triggered between devices while enabling more flexible control and modification of shared datastructures behind reliability measures like fast reroute.

The P4 language is currently incompatible with heterogeneous hardware, to some extent; written dataplane programs are typically tied to a particular switch model, for instance V1Model, \gls{acr:psa}, NetFPGA SUME, or the Tofino Native Architecture.
Network architects typically factor in hardware from several manufacturers to prevent vendor lock-in, but the P4 model for each of these has its own metadata types, hardware constraints and quirks which developers must be aware of.
While architectures such as the \gls{acr:psa} are more general and should, in principle, support several target switches, it is often preferable to use a switch's own architecture for performance or specific optimisation reasons.
As a result it is currently tedious to write and maintain a unified dataplane that is provably uniform across different packet processing devices.
$\mu$\emph{P4}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SoniR0DF20} extends the P4 compiler to decompose parser and action code into independent subprograms which may be composed together in a more simple manner by programmers.
This simplifies porting behaviours between different switch models---particularly in separating out (and integrating) complex interactions and dependencies between parser, deparser and action code stages.
\emph{Lyra}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/GaoZLMZTSCZY20} is a language for running switch programs e.g., P4 and Broadcom's \emph{NPL}~\parencite{broadcom-npl}, across heterogeneous switch hardware, while also handling placement constraints.
Lyra expresses the entire network dataplane using the `one big switch' abstraction, and compiles from its own higher-level language to an intermediate representation and then to P4 or NPL.
Compilation is combined with topology information about the target network, as well as placement constraints, to generate an optimal embedding in the network using a \gls{acr:smt} solver.

As is the case when programming host machines, verifying that a dataplane program behaves correctly---both within a single switch and the wider dataplane with regards to code and \gls{acr:mat} contents---presents its own set of challenges.
In particular, fully programmable dataplanes enable new classes of bugs such as header malformations which existing network verification tools are not designed to handle.
This is complicated further still by the fact that a P4 program's operation is determined also by the control plane and the contents of its \glspl{acr:mat}.
\emph{P4-NoD}~\parencite{mckeown2016automatically} is an earlier solution to the problem, translating invariants into Datalog for verification by older tooling while modelling correctly emitted packets via pairwise `packet acceptance' constraints between switches.
\emph{p4v}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/LiuHSSLSWCMF18} combines guarantees about the bounds of control plane values with expected output invariants to detect counter-example packets using a \gls{acr:smt} solver.
\emph{bf4}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/DumitrescuSNR20} endeavours to make the annotation task considerably easier for programmers, again relying on \gls{acr:smt} solvers to also produce control plane rule filters and candidate bug fixes.
\emph{Aquila}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/TianGLZCZDYMTLW21} achieves a similar class of \gls{acr:smt}-solver based verification, using a new language which makes it easier to express dataplane invariants across one or more switches.
Aquila further innovates in using \gls{acr:smt} counterexamples to localise likely locations and fixes for bugs, as well as developing numerous domain-specific optimisations to generated logical formulae.

\paragraph{Hardware design}
While the pipelined model of the \gls{acr:psa} is undeniably effective, it can be restrictive for many classes of dataplane program; for instance cases where processing is based on more than raw packet events, or where more complex dataflow is required between functions.
\emph{PANIC}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/StephensAS18} offers one solution by placing a routing fabric between distinct packet and data processing elements in a SmartNIC.
Such a design would enable general, asynchronous, and novel compute in SmartNICs and switches, for instance offering consistent and easy to use communication between workers versus hard-coded \gls{acr:me} relationships or ordering dependencies between subprograms across pipelines.

?? PANIC also allows multi-tenancy now?~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/LinPSSA20}

?? Multitenant PSA?~\parencite{DBLP:conf/conext/StoyanovZ20}

%?? Taurus moved out of representations section~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2002-08987,DBLP:conf/asplos/SwamyR0GO22}
Although \gls{acr:ml} can be made feasible in \gls{acr:pdp} hardware as we'll discuss shortly, achieving more complex or higher-precision inference at line-rate can only be enabled by dedicated architectural support.
\emph{Taurus}~\parencite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2002-08987,DBLP:conf/asplos/SwamyR0GO22} is a proposal to add compute and memory units to the \gls{acr:psa} as part of a map-reduce block specifically designed to optimise per-packet \gls{acr:ml} inference.
In particular, it demonstrates that efficient line-rate inference can be achieved using a \gls{acr:cgra} of map-reduce units between the ingress and egress pipelines---implementing \glspl{acr:nn}, \gls{acr:lstm} networks, or \glspl{acr:svm} which process every packet header vector.
In turn, the outputs of any classifiers in this block become available to later pipeline stages, which are able to act upon packets accordingly.
Training \gls{acr:ml} models online using Taurus requires sampling from input packets to be directed towards a cooperating host machine, and cannot be performed unassisted.

%?? Are the tools just sharper now?

\section{Offloading and In-Network Compute}\label{sec:offloading-and-in-network-compute}
%?? Explain rationale first...
As we've explored in \cref{sec:from-fixed-function-to-fully-programmable}, modern networks now have a large variety of tools to enable traffic and packet processing, including hosts, programmable switches, SmartNIC devices, and middleboxes---all in tandem with control plane programmability.
%?? Diverse set of devices having different perf characteristics in latency/tput, reachability, prioce points, degrees of programmabiklity
This diverse set of devices also means that market silicon now offers a wide variety in performance characteristics such as latency and throughput, connectivity, price points, and degrees of programmability.
%Explain \cref{fig:pdp-lit-steering} more fully in-text
%?? (a) has some benefits: if both close to each other, then most of path is the same---key for CDNs, DDoS scubbing etc. or when we want to use PDP provided by others' infra.
%?? (b) is a necessity -- pkts must be moved away 
%?? (c) can be bump-in-wire host or dedicated device, but minimum impact on path. Or AS. When can (c) not be achieved?
Accordingly, network architects must also consider how best to integrate \glspl{acr:nf} backed by these capabilities into their networks.
Consider \cref{fig:pdp-lit-steering}: to minimise extra latency costs imposed on carried traffic as well as control plane complexity, we want to minimise the amount of \emph{traffic steering} required.
In the worst case, traffic may need to be routed to another organisation to make use of high-volume services like \gls{acr:ddos} traffic scrubbing, \glspl{acr:cdn}, or \gls{acr:pdp} capabilities exposed by cloud compute\sidenote{These classes of service tend to have enough geographical replication that the network function and the target server are reasonably close to one another, for instance in proximity to a shared \gls{acr:ixp}. As such, users' paths to both nodes are likely to be similar, the last few hops excepted.} (\cref{fig:pdp-lit-steering:off}).
Steering within \glspl{acr:as} as in \cref{fig:pdp-lit-steering:semi-on} is a necessity to enable \gls{acr:vnf} chaining between host machines in a way which is reliably reconfigurable, but this naturally increases routing and processing latency as well as bandwidth demands in the \gls{acr:as} in question.
The only way to eliminate steering costs completely is to place dataplane programs \emph{on-path} (\cref{fig:pdp-lit-steering:on})---but this has key drawbacks.
If we place commodity hosts in-line like this, then they will be unable to meet line-rate demands in faster networks; we have also given up the flexible reconfiguration and horizontal scalability that steering bought us.
\gls{acr:pdp} innovations like programmable \gls{acr:asic}-backed switches and SmartNICs are the best tools for performing processing here, but not every application can be run at these locations due to the limits of their respective compute models.

	\caption[The spectrum of on-path traffic processing.]{To introduce packet processing to the network, engineers must make a conscious decision about where such processing may be installed, and if needed how traffic can be steered there---this leads to spectrum of how on-path processing may be. The main sizes and types of redirections are shown here: (a) having to redirect to another network for packet processing, (b) internally rerouting and steering packets to reach one or more processing machines (i.e., in \gls{acr:vnf} scenarios), and (c) placing processing \emph{directly in-path}. Generally speaking, smaller path deviations have a smaller latency impact. Paths and \gls{acr:as} relationships here are purely for demonstration, and may be longer in practice (similarly, case (b) may occur entirely within a single data centre \gls{acr:as}). Appliances performing packet processing are coloured {\color{uofgrust} in rust}.\label{fig:pdp-lit-steering}}
\end{figure}

These new, specialised devices are a double-edged sword---making efficient use of \emph{all} network resources becomes non-trivial due to device heterogeneity in architecture and capabilities.
Ideally, we want to maximise the number of packets which are served by on-path, in-network functions such as in \cref{fig:pdp-lit-steering:on}.
Even when using consistent programming models like P4, using all of a device's capabilities is difficult, requiring hardware-specific expertise, training, microarchitectural knowledge and experience.
At the same time, organisations would prefer to accelerate the code they already have rather than re-architect solutions from the ground up.
%Operators and engineers can choose from these according to their needs, enabling new in-network use cases, but this is also something of a double-edged sword.
%?? Double-edged sword: how to use it all?
Can we then accelerate \emph{individual parts} of a packet processing stack?

%?? Such power is a double edged sword; how to use. Difficult; expertise, training, microarchitectural knowledge and experience, languages...
%?? Not just all of a packet program, but at the granularity of *parts* of such a program
%?? Notion extends within the host stack, also
%?? Offloading was originally used to refer to simple accelerations which could be delegated to the hardware to free up host machine resources: packet splitting to MTU size, diving requests among coresa (RSS), and checksumming at various levels
%?? Maximise proportion of traffic served by best-case deplyoments

%Offloading: Moving part or all of a program to execute elsewhere (why? improved latency, perf, tput, take advantage of existing heterogeneous hardware). Good even if just partial: especially if slow path is uncommon. I.e., early-exit good. Can be in-host, or between host and devices. OR to fall back to a more capable/accurate computation env. Relate to above: enables routing through low-latency, high-tput in-network routes.

\emph{Offloading} is the process of moving part or all of a packet processing function elsewhere to improve overall performance---reducing latency or increasing throughput---typically by taking advantage of novel heterogeneous hardware.
Originally, this referred to simpler transport-level accelerations which \glspl{acr:nic} could perform in hardware which would free up \gls{acr:cpu} cycles on a host machine, such as checksum offloads, large send \& receive offloads to split \& coalesce larger than \gls{acr:mtu}-size packets, and receive-side scaling.
Both existing \gls{acr:sdn} switches and \gls{acr:pdp} hardware can be taken advantage of to optimise a target dataplane, enabling a very generic and useful kind of offloading.
This extends also to host machines, which have no shortage of technologies for improving packet processing by shifting user code into the network stack or skipping the kernel entirely, and may use attached SmartNICs to accelerate applications or transport logic.

For argument's sake suppose that we want to process packets using a firewall, followed by a primitive statistical or \gls{acr:ml} model, and followed again by a \gls{acr:dpi} block in the event that the second stage emits a warning.
Naturally, the simplest deployment is to have all three functions installed on host machines, but this is also the most wasteful.
While I'll introduce specific examples later, the only function here which would currently require a host machine would be the final \gls{acr:dpi} block; even then, this is only required by a small subset of packets which trip an earlier-stage alarm.
As such, routing all packets via a \gls{acr:vnf} chain imposes steering and the higher costs of host-based execution upon all packets, to say nothing of the reduced throughput per box.
A more optimal solution is to install the firewall rules into the \gls{acr:tcam}-backed \glspl{acr:mat} of commodity switches, which \emph{can} perform these checks at line-rate, and to offload the statistical logic into similarly on-path programmable switches or \glspl{acr:nic} at a lower arithmetic precision.
In this case we have a hardware-accelerated fast path without any unneeded steering, while only packets which need to fall back to a more capable or accurate computation environment take the (less likely) slow path.

%The concept of offloading extends also to host machines, where...
The key problem is that automatically offloading arbitrary functions is an open research challenge.
Different devices expose different programming models and languages, and have unique capabilities and limitations; additional or missing \glspl{acr:fu}, code store size limits, threading models, and other resources.
\gls{acr:pdp} devices have additional constraints on reconfiguration: firmware installation can take from seconds to minutes, limiting a chain's pliability as nodes cease to function for extended periods of time without ample provisioning to handle transition states.
Individual functions are also tricky to interconnect (i.e., passing variable state between \gls{acr:nf} stages), to compute the ideal layout of in the network, and to provision even in single tenant scenarios.
%?? tricky to interconnect, layout, provision.

\emph{In-network compute} is a connected concept, exploring novel applications which can be enabled or made scalable entirely through \gls{acr:pdp} hardware.
Rather than moving subprograms and arbitrary logical snippets down the stack, in-network compute seeks to move dedicated, complex, or involved applications onto \gls{acr:pdp} hardware, asking how to take advantage of intrinsic capabilities of dataplane devices.
Such research demands more careful exploration in algorithms and data formats, pushing the limits of what programs may be expressed in restricted environments such as P4.
What makes this an exciting area of study is that in-network applications often are defined by a tangled net of benefits and costs.
Suppose in \cref{fig:pdp-lit-steering:on} the two endpoint machines first check or update state using another service (i.e., key-value store) before communicating with one another.
By moving this service \emph{completely into the \gls{acr:pdp} infrastructure}, entire \glspl{acr:rtt} worth of communication delay can be eliminated.
In data centre networks, where \glspl{acr:rtt} are already $\mathcal{O}\left(\unit{\micro\second}\right)$, simply placing a host in-line would undo most of this latency reduction\sidenote{While host offloading frameworks have come a long way, there are data transfer costs which cannot be elided which we'll discuss in \cref{sec:wtf}.} while being unable to meet rack-scale fanout.
Further example services may also aggregate data from many sources to allow a single host to process it, or apply per-packet \gls{acr:ml} inference at line rate; when end-hosts and the network fabric are all jointly owned, there is great scope for tighter network-app integration and what it might enable.
Notably, handcrafted in-network services such as \gls{acr:ml} inference might replace entire blocks in an \gls{acr:nf} chain, better supporting \gls{acr:vnf} offloading by making better use of the underlying hardware.
The costs incurred by such services are also interesting.
In-network \gls{acr:ml} must sacrifice accuracy---the lack of \glspl{acr:fpu} in network hardware forces implementers to employ fixed-point arithmetic or other data formats.
Not all programs may be moved down to \gls{acr:pdp} hardware unaltered.

We'll cover here technologies in use for host offloading, such as \gls{acr:xdp}, as well as the rationale and costs of host processing (\cref{sec:host-offloading-technologies}).
Through \cref{sec:frameworks-for-automatic-offloading}, I'll cover recent works making use of host offloading techniques and \gls{acr:pdp} hardware to provide automatic acceleration and for dataplane programs.
Although in-network compute has been justified and explained here, its use cases will be left until later (\cref{sec:in-network-compute-use-cases}).

\subsection{Host Offloading Technologies}\label{sec:host-offloading-technologies}
Commodity host machines are designed in such a way that packet processing often incurs higher latency than using an \gls{acr:asic} positioned at the same point in the network.
Consider \cref{fig:pdp-lit-pci}, which shows the physical interconnect between a \gls{acr:nic} and \gls{acr:cpu}.
Network connectivity is a \emph{peripheral} function, and so \gls{acr:nic} are connected over the \gls{acr:pcie} bus.
To be processed by host machines, the \gls{acr:nic} must move packet data across the \gls{acr:pcie} bus by \gls{acr:dma} into \gls{acr:ram}, where the host \gls{acr:cpu}(s) can make use of this data---this may be accelerated by copying the data also into L3 cache in the same step, via functionality like Intel DDIO~\parencite{intel-ddio}.
While \gls{acr:pcie} offers extraordinary bandwidth (\qty{63.015}{\giga\byte\per\second} in \gls{acr:pcie} \num{5.0}), moving data across the bus adds $\mathcal{O}\left(\unit{\micro\second}\right)$ of latency.
Quoting figures from \Textcite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/NeugebauerAZAL018}, \qtyrange{64}{1500}{\byte} packets spend \qtyrange{0.8}{1.8}{\micro\second} solely in \gls{acr:pcie}, comprising \qtyrange{90.6}{77.2}{\percent} of the total one-way delay (\qtyrange{0.883}{2.331}{\micro\second})---dwarfing the latency contribution of the \gls{acr:nic}.
These physical costs cannot be removed with standard \glspl{acr:nic}: the host \gls{acr:cpu} must have the packet body entirely resident in its own memory to act upon it.

Moving packets between the \gls{acr:nic} and \gls{acr:cpu} is more involved than simple steering, as packets must be moved across the \gls{acr:pcie} bus and \gls{acr:dma}'d into host memory. The host \gls{acr:cpu} is made aware of packet arrivals by either \glspl{acr:irq} or polling ring buffers in memory which the \gls{acr:nic} writes into. This introduces additional latency, even when the networking stack supports direct insertion into the \gls{acr:cpu} cache. Note that this figure leaves aside \gls{acr:numa} constraints and costs arising from having several \glspl{acr:cpu}.}\label{fig:pdp-lit-pci}

Most of the impact on traffic processing originates also from logical costs due to the \gls{acr:os}'s device and network stack management.
\Cref{fig:pdp-lit-offloading} lays out some of these stages in the Linux environment.
Primarily, the \gls{acr:os} kernel is notified that packet \glspl{acr:dma} have completed via \glspl{acr:irq}, at which point a kernel thread is awoken and the device driver is called to transfer the packet contents into a \gls{acr:skb} usable by the stack.\sidenote{The conventional network stack does not poll for packets---while this reduces any additional delays associated with the interrupt model, running a device driver in a busy loop is not generally considered feasible or acceptable. This model does drive specialist frameworks like \gls{acr:dpdk}, which we'll cover, but this requires care and significant changes in userland code.}
Awaking a thread does not guarantee that it will be instantly ready to serve the packet, adding latency, while readying packet \glspl{acr:skb} adds additional per-packet overheads which harm receive-side latency and throughput.
The Linux network stack itself must then inspect \glspl{acr:skb} to handle, for instance, decapsulation, transport logic such as \gls{acr:tcp} and \gls{acr:cca} management, and connection handling---among other functions related in more much detail by existing work~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/CaiCVH021}.
Finally, the packet is served over a socket to a (possibly sleeping) userland thread, who may require a context switch before the received data may be finally used---again, another source of processing latency.

%?? IRQs enable, but can take time for CPU to awaken.
%?? Linux network stack -- encapsulations, segmentation, \gls{acr:tcp} and transport logic, connection management etc.
%?? typical sockets: sleep rather than poll (and again, await context switch).

Interestingly, these additional hardware and software costs are analogous to route-level steering on a smaller scale.
%?? Make the argument around existing doftware needing a reasonable OS?
A more specialised packet processing stack might be one way to remove as many of the software costs as possible, but such a clean-slate proposition would lock packet processing functions out of access to software reliant on functions exposed by typical \glspl{acr:os}.
%Instead, recent years have brought greater kernel support for eliminating as many of these stages as possible.
\emph{Host offloading frameworks} aim instead to reduce this steering as far as possible with support from the \gls{acr:os} or hardware; either by eliminating as much of the logical packet processing invoked by the \gls{acr:os} kernel as possible, or moving user code to an earlier point in the stack.
Returning to \cref{fig:pdp-lit-offloading}, we now turn our focus on the user programmable blocks.
In the best case, hardware such as SmartNICs allow for user code to be moved onto the \gls{acr:nic}, removing \gls{acr:pcie} bus transfer latency as packet processing no longer needs to touch the \gls{acr:cpu}.
Of course SmartNICs are typically less capable than hosts (in clock speeds and included \glspl{acr:fu}), and for that reason we'll briefly discuss kernel bypass methods such as \gls{acr:dpdk} and offloads enabled by \gls{acr:ebpf}.
As before offloaded user code may be some or all of a larger program, potentially divided into fast and slow paths according to whether host compute is needed.

Crucially, all these mechanisms excise various amounts of processing or imprecise waiting for  interrupts, reducing latencies and increasing packet processing throughput.

\paragraph{Kernel bypass and DPDK}
?? First: what does each do.
later netmap~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/Rizzo12}

\gls{acr:dpdk}~\parencite{dpdk,dpdk-ad-paper}

\paragraph{eBPF and XDP}
The \glsxtrfull{acr:ebpf}~\parencite{ebpf-history} is a register-based \gls{acr:risc} \gls{acr:vm} and assembly language, used today for moving packet programs early into the kernel, instrumenting standard kernel functions using tracepoints, and offloading owing to its simple and easily-implemented design.
\gls{acr:ebpf} is derived from the earlier \emph{BSD Packet Filter}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/McCanneJ93}, which was a two-register \gls{acr:vm} designed to allow user-written programs to be safely executed at the kernel level---in this case, for preventing unnecessary packet copies for unwanted traffic or packet contents in monitoring applications like \emph{tcpdump}.
`Arbitrary, sandboxed user code in the kernel' was certainly an idea with potential, and owing to its uptake in other regions of the kernel it was modified to become more capable and closer in architecture to modern \glspl{acr:cpu}: for instance ten \qty{64}{\bit} registers, atomic instructions, maps, and function call opcodes to make use of functions exposed by the kernel.

Today the \gls{acr:vm} abstraction enables fast and safe execution of such programs by \gls{acr:jit} compilation and verification, and is now well-suited for offloading to SmartNICs and similar devices as industry-standard compilers support \gls{acr:ebpf} as a compile target from languages such as C and Rust.
%\gls{acr:ebpf} is now a compiler target for simple platform-agnostic programs, which are well-suited for offloading due to their bounded size, verifiable semantics, and the simplicity of the underlying \gls{acr:vm}. ?? ebabling JIT?
In the Linux \gls{acr:os} kernel, \gls{acr:ebpf} programs may be triggered by \emph{hooks} for instrumenting its operation via \emph{kprobes} and \emph{tracepoints}---a program specifies its type with respect to its intended hook, from which the kernel knows which functions an \gls{acr:ebpf} program may call (effectively enforcing an \gls{acr:api}).
Programs are accepted if and only if they are loop-free, terminate, have bounded size, and simulated bounds checks on array accesses are well-defined.
Larger programs may be constructed by building chains of tail calls between these smaller \gls{acr:ebpf} blocks.
Userland and \gls{acr:ebpf} programs communicate using \emph{maps}, which are a generic abstraction around containers such as arrays, hash tables, and longest-prefix match tables which may be read and modified by user and kernel code.

%\gls{acr:ebpf}~\parencite{ebpf-history}, 
%?? It should be clear that \gls{acr:ebpf}'s role in the network owes an inestimable debt to \emph{smart packets}.

%?? Came from BPF~\parencite{DBLP:conf/usenix/McCanneJ93}

%?? eBPF also allows exec of user code at various points in kernel for instrumentation etc. via \emph{kprobes} and \emph{tracepoints}.

Linux's \glsxtrfull{acr:xdp}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/conext/Hoiland-Jorgensen18} uses \gls{acr:ebpf} to place user-specified code into the packet processing path.
Naturally, these programs undergo the same verification and \gls{acr:jit} compilation as traditional \gls{acr:ebpf} hook programs, and run one instance per \gls{acr:nic} receive queue.\sidenote{This can present a bottleneck for the amount of code offloaded to this stage in \glspl{acr:nic} without support for several receive queues---the \gls{acr:xdp} hook must meet strict timing constraints. \qty{1}{\giga\bit\per\second} integrated \glspl{acr:nic} present this problem, in my experience.}
\gls{acr:xdp} hook programs however have a slightly more privileged role, and are called before the network stack for all packets arriving on an interface to determine their ultimate fate.
For instance, packets may be modified and immediately transmitted back on the wire, dropped, passed on to the remainder of the host networking stack, or redirected to another \gls{acr:xdp} program or user-land socket.
Consider once more \cref{fig:pdp-lit-offloading}.
If driver support is offered, offloaded code may be run before any \gls{acr:skb} management or creation with zero memory copies (\emph{Native}).
Otherwise, the program runs after \gls{acr:skb} creation (\emph{Generic}), but before any part of the remainder of the networking stack.
Note that packets may be served \emph{entirely} in the \gls{acr:xdp} hook by making use of maps, packet modification, and the \texttt{XDP\_TX} immediate transmit action, minimising latencies as far as possible in an \gls{acr:irq}-based system.
Moreover, \gls{acr:xdp} is flexible enough to fit into a wide variety of packet processing stacks.

This is accompanied by the \texttt{AF\_XDP}~\parencite{lwn-af-xdp} socket family, which may circumvent the remainder of the network stack by sending the packet directly to user code from an \gls{acr:xdp} hook.
The file descriptors of these sockets are placed in an \gls{acr:ebpf} map, enabling faster packet processing by reducing the time delta between the fast and slow packet paths.
User and kernel code share a set of ring buffers and queues to pass packet-sized buffers between another in response to completions and demand.
While map sizes are fixed at compile time, sockets have a many-to-one relationship with the actual hook program, enabling per-core or per-application service of packets to make better use of cache coherence.
\texttt{AF\_XDP} sockets support both poll- and \gls{acr:irq}-mode at the user level.

\subsection{Frameworks for Automatic Offloading}\label{sec:frameworks-for-automatic-offloading}

?? mention BPFabric~\parencite{DBLP:conf/ancs/JouetP17} somewhere.

?? mention how it came to this: this was an alternate solution to latency or throughput concerns which plague VNF approaches as they scale (see Metron~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/KatsikasBKSM18} paper for good discussion of RSS, etc., which solve these problems in their own way)

?? Morpheus~\parencite{DBLP:conf/asplos/MianoSRRA22} for run-time optimisation.

?? Cool NIC-CPU co-design~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/IbanezMAJ0KM21}

\emph{ClickNP}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/LiTLPLXXC16} targets NetFPGAs: DAG of predefined Click-like blocks, i.e. VHDL segments.
Why?
The C$\rightarrow$VHDL pipeline leads to awful code, so this achieves better FPGA usage.

\emph{Floem}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/PhothilimthanaL18} presents a DSL in python, which compiles to C for host and specific target NIC.
This does require specific dev effort per-target-NIC.

\emph{iPipe}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/LiuCSKPG19} runs C language programs on SmartNIC (intended) and host (emergency) according to whether traffic is at-risk of suffering from SmartNIC resource contention.
Processing is dynamically `unoffloaded' back to the host machine if SmartNIC load is too great.
This requires identical language support on both accelerator and host---which is very much not guaranteed.

\emph{hXDP}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/osdi/BrunellaBBPSBCP20} allows eBPF execution on FPGA---supports expanded eBPF ISA rather than converting program into a complete pipelined circuit (i.e., this runs as a coprocessor).
Why?
Fast redesign/reinstall time: a complete circuit bake takes ages, while JITing and compiling an eBPF program into their new ISA is pretty fast.
This includes some very cool details on around VLIW instruction-level parallelism built into their ISA and figured out during compile-time.

\emph{Gallium}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/ZhangZK20} converts a C++ (ClickNF program)$\rightarrow$auto-leverage PDP (P4 + C++ + P4).
Split into pre- and post-host P4 segments, with a host C++ program.
Gallium uses LLVM IR to determine read-write dependencies between variables/basic-blocks, account for PDP capabilities of packet reads (i.e., PDP can't touch packet body past $\sim$\qty{300}{\byte}), can move about \qty{100}{\byte} metadata between sites.
Identifies fast/slow paths if offloading can be elided.
Main drawback is that some annotation needed to translate Click primitives into MATs etc., otherwise the conversion to P4 means minimal additional work per target accelerator.

\emph{Flightplan}~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/SultanaSGPHSBDL21} splits P4 program into subchunks placed and routed between \{PDP, FPGA, host, server, NPU, ASIC\} for pipelining (i.e., performance) or redundancy.
Their disaggregation inserts blocks before and after splits to handle metadata (state) passing.
Their compiler breaks the programs on basic blocks with user annotations, where specific implementations manually given for some \texttt{extern}s to enable device-specific acceleration.
Data dependencies between basic blocks are extracted from the P4 IR in P4C compiler.

Preliminary work on splitting eBPF programs between an XDP part and userland part has been proposed~\parencite{DBLP:conf/conext/ShahinfarMSSBA21}.
This considers both horizontal (i.e., chunks in driver with XDP tail-calls) or vertical (user$\leftrightarrow$kernel) splits of code.
I think their XDP vs.~AF\_XDP split test confirms that the first handler in the XDP hook is basically single-threaded, which probably has some implications for our use of it as an offload.

%\paragraph{Misc P4 translations.}
%T4P4S~\parencite{DBLP:conf/hpsr/VorosHKLTL18} converts P4 programs into C, which are linked against a target-specific network hardware abstraction layer.
%This seems to be the most effective host deployment for P4 at the moment, since it buys you DPDK-capable P4 dataplane installation compared to how terribly slow BMv2 is known to be.
%Slower than native DPDK, but outpaces OvS, and allows definition of HAL binaries in SmartNIC C code as needed too.
%
%$\mu$P4~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/SoniR0DF20} extends P4C to decompose parser and action code into independent subprograms, to simplify porting behaviours between different switch models (V1Model, PSA, SUME, ...).

\subsection{Denial of Service Attacks}
---
?? Normal ones? TCP exhaustion? Application-Level? Sheer bandwidth?

Mirai used as DDoS vector \cite{DBLP:conf/uss/AntonakakisABBB17}.

%?? Big survey \cite{DBLP:conf/imc/JonkerKKRSD17}?
\Textcite{DBLP:conf/imc/JonkerKKRSD17} offer an in-depth analysis and taxonomy of the current landscape of DoS attacks.
They observe that Denial-of-Service is most commonly achieved through \emph{resource exhaustion}---either at the target server or the infrastructure serving it.
Attacks may be classified according to two orthogonal axes: \emph{Direct vs.\ Reflection} and \emph{Volumetric vs.\ Semantic}.
\begin{description}
	\item[Direct] Attackers send packets directly towards their target. Random IP spoofing is often used to make blacklisting more difficult, but leaves evidence of an attack and its characteristics due to \emph{backscatter}, visible to internet telescopes.
	\item[Reflection] Attackers send traffic to a \emph{reflector}, spoofing the source IP of packets to match that of the target. The reflector sends replies to the target, often \emph{amplifying} them in the process.
	\item[Volumetric] DoS is achieved by \emph{resource exhaustion}---CPU or RAM usage at the target host, overfilling transmission buffers along key traffic routes. These are ``service agnostic''.
	\item[Semantic] DoS is achieved by \emph{exploiting program logic}, for instance to crash a target application server. Often tailor-made for a particular service or its deployment environment, such as \emph{Teardrop attacks}.
\end{description}
They find that TCP tends to be the leading transport for direct random-spoofing attacks, while reflection and amplification attacks are dominated by UDP-like protocols (NTP$>$DNS$>$CharGen).
Randomly spoofed direct attacks are found to last longer, and are most intense around ``web ports'' (HTTP, SSH, etc.), evidence is seen to support the existence of ``joint attacks''.
The scale of all attacks is immense, by their measurements: at least a third of the internet is under attack at any one point in time, with at least \num{30000} attacks \emph{visible} each day.

\paragraph{Amplification attacks}
abuse network services with small request bodies and large responses, causing a typically benign service to forward traffic on an attacker's behalf by \emph{reflection}---spoofing the source IP of requests to that of the intended victim.
An attacker requires that the Autonomous System (AS) they belong to doesn't prevent IP spoofing at egress.
In exchange, they are able to split their upstream bandwidth across many reflectors to gain higher volumes of attack traffic from multiple sources without revealing their own IP to the victim.

UDP-based protocols are the typical basis for such attacks, as the transport is connectionless.
While DNS is the most well-known vector for amplification, \textcite{DBLP:conf/ndss/Rossow14} presents an in-depth survey of a wide variety of other vulnerable protocols alongside a rough census of abusable servers.
He examines network services (SNMPv2, NTP, DNS, NetBIOS, SSDP), legacy services (CharGen, QoTD), peer-to-peer networks (BitTorrent, Kad), online games (Steam, Quake 3) and externally abusable botnets (ZAv2, Sality, Gameover).
Scanning for \num{e5} amplifiers of a popular service can be done in minutes, making NTP particularly dangerous due to its high amplification rate.
Furthermore, he notes that the security-focused DNSSEC can exacerbate the problem by the addition of large signatures to message payloads.

\textcite{DBLP:conf/uss/KuhrerHRH14} build further upon this census; they find significant overlap between servers who expose different vulnerable services, connect these services to OS fingerprints, and are able to use DNS proxies to enumerate the ASs who allow IP spoofing.
They find that many eligible reflectors (for i.e., DNS) tend to lie behind dynamic IP addresses and so undergo significant churn (meaning an attacker must often re-scan every few days/weeks).
This is not the case for certain protocols like NTP, where the server list remains far more stable.
The authors also explore the amplification potential of all TCP-based services---given that well-known protocols like HTTP cannot be blocked in most infrastructures, an attacker can abuse retransmissions of the handshake (\texttt{SYN-ACK}) to achieve an amplification factor up to \num{20} if the receiver doesn't send \texttt{RST}.
Differing TCP stacks have varying quirks, so the behaviour of the victim and all reflectors can be hard to predict without prior fingerprinting.
It can be observed that choosing amplifiers of larger geographic distance might increase the amount of \texttt{SYN-ACK} packets in flight before the well-meaning reflector can receive a \texttt{RST}.

NTP quickly became the attack vector of choice \cite{DBLP:conf/imc/CzyzKGPBK14}.
They find that most vulnerable amplifiers are \emph{end-hosts}, typically offering \qty{4}{\times} amplification.
At the time of publication, they observed that NTP amplification attacks had risen in volume by $\sim$\qty{1000}{\times}, though were slowly declining; of particular interest is that \qty{85}{\percent} of attacks over \qty{100}{\giga\bit\per\second} relied upon NTP reflection.
The decrease, they posit, stems mostly from vulnerable servers being patched in response to recent bulletins making the risk very clear to server operators.
How are these patched servers distributed?
They observe that, after the patch period, many of the remaining vulnerable servers are sparsely distributed (rather, the patched servers are clustered under IP blocks).
This is in line with the (un)cleanliness hypothesis put forth by \textcite{DBLP:conf/imc/CollinsSFJWSK07}.
While there were many almost comical findings (a surfeit of NTP servers holding the incorrect time, old versions), of greatest concern was the presence of ``mega-amplifiers'' offering \SIrange{e3}{e9}{\times} amplification due to the presence of network loops.
Over the duration of their study, they observed a \SI{92}{\percent} reduction in abusable IPs, though the uncleanliness observation recurs as the reduction is smaller when considering /24 prefixes (\SI{72}{\percent}).
Regardless, this drop is \emph{far} more significant than any seen in the availability of Open DNS resolvers.
A large part of the remaining vulnerable machines are identified as end hosts, implying that quick fixes are unlikely.
They make it clear that it is hard to reason about who the attackers are (bots, organisers or botmasters), and for what reasons they launch attacks (although ancillary evidence suggests that a remarkably common motivation me be rivalry through, e.g., games).

\Textcite{DBLP:conf/imc/KuhrerHBRH15} investigate the landscape of \emph{open recursive DNS resolvers}, one of the major enabling factors for DNS amplification attacks.
Specifically, a DNS server is said to be \emph{open} if it does not filter requests by source IP address.
The existence of such servers is, they claim, paradoxical: rare is the need to publicly expose recursive DNS resolution when the servers should operate in a well-structured (hierarchical) manner.
By scanning across all IPv4 addresses (according to the methodology of \textcite{DBLP:conf/uss/DurumericWH13}), they discover a downward trend in abusable servers (from \num{26.8e6} to \num{17.8e6} over the year) due to blocked requests/DNS filtering/shutdown/IP churn.
As it turns out, many of these DNS servers run old and vulnerable software, and are very highly represented (\SI{67}{\percent}) by consumer routers linked to dynamic IPs.
Curiously, cache snooping reveals that \SI{61}{\percent} of all open DNS resolvers see active use---many of these resolvers are legit (\SIrange{85}{92}{\percent}), with some even filtering out malicious domains.
The illegitimate set corresponded to censorship in Iran and China, and to malicious redirection to snooping proxies or outright malware.

As of \citeyear{DBLP:conf/imc/JonkerKKRSD17}, the distribution of amplification attacks over UDP protocols was observed to roughly have the pattern (NTP$>$DNS$>$CharGen).
This is in spite of the evidence put forth by \textcite{DBLP:conf/imc/CzyzKGPBK14}, which suggested a decline of NTP-based amplification attacks.
Perhaps the effort to patch up many servers simply hit a (metaphorical) wall of operators who actually cared, thus leaving many viable NTP amplifiers in the wild?

?? Any observations from \textcite{DBLP:conf/raid/KramerKMNKYR15}?

\paragraph{Transit-link attacks}
do some stuff according to these guys \cite{DBLP:conf/sp/SmithS18} (who defend against it), and these guys (who predicted it)---Crossfire \cite{DBLP:conf/sp/KangLG13}, Coremelt \cite{DBLP:conf/esorics/StuderP09}.

\paragraph{Characteristics}

?? Botnet C\&C communication \cite{DBLP:conf/sac/ZandVYK14}? NOT READ

?? \SI{69}{\percent} of targets are web servers \cite{DBLP:conf/imc/JonkerKKRSD17}.

DDoS attacks evolve over timescales of seconds to months.
\Textcite{DBLP:conf/spw/KangGS16} investigate this, and consider the implications and considerations necessary to deal with such occurrences.
Why might attackers desire this?
The authors posit that a diverse attack portfolio makes for more effective attacks, so long as there is \emph{variation}---a single suite or pattern of evolution makes defence (and discovery of the attacker) far simpler.
We see such evolution in:
\begin{description}
	\item[Volume and Capabilities] Peak \SI{300}{\gibi\bit\per\second}$\rightarrow$\SI{600}{\gibi\bit\per\second} over the last 4 years from date of publication.
	\item[Attack targets] E.g., Spamhaus---attackers moved from targeting endpoint servers to targeting the routers in \emph{internet exchange points} (IXPs) once the former was detected.
	\item[Strategy] E.g., semantic attacks $\rightarrow$ volumetric (TCP \texttt{SYN} flood) $\rightarrow$ volumetric (NTP amplification) $\rightarrow$ LFA.
\end{description}
They find that evolution in capabilities occurs over longer timescales, as these typically require resource acquisition (knowledge, bots, etc.).
\emph{Strategies}, however, are easily poised to evolve over short time horizons, typically ``[adapting] to the target's (observed) defensive posture''.
This behaviour was observed in both the cases of SpamHaus and ProtonMail.
In light of this, they suggest a two-tier approach to defence.
To thwart rational adversaries, they suggest the use of \emph{deterrents}---mechanisms located at e.g., a single network point, which can detect attacks and thus increase the cost of maintenance.
Most defences fit this description.
To handle cost-insensitive attackers, they suggest collaborative approaches (such as SENSS \cite{DBLP:conf/acsac/RamanathanMYZ18}).
Unfortunately, the work makes little attempt to describe or study the patterns of short-term evolution which might be expected in a real-world attack.

?? I think we need some other sources to reason about things from a game theoretic perspective---it seems to me that evolution is the name of the game \cite{DBLP:conf/atal/SinhaKT16} (not read this, but seemed relevant at the time).

\paragraph{Amplification}
\textcite{DBLP:conf/ndss/Rossow14}.
?? Inbound/outbound traffic ratios at victim (above a certain bw thres).
?? At the amp, scan activity in surrounding darknets can be an indicator.
?? At the amp, similar ratio analysis (scaled to account for benign activity and real clients who require high bandwidth: lower amp, higher bw).

\textcite{DBLP:conf/imc/CzyzKGPBK14} observe some further hallmarks specific to NTP attacks.
The \texttt{monlist} command principally used as the basis for such attacks can often reveal the list of recent targets after the fact, offering external investigators a means to determine which open NTP servers see active use as amplifiers (and their unwilling victims).
An interesting observation stemming from these records is that the sets of amplifiers and victims are both highly clustered across ASes---individually, that is.
Furthermore, it is observed that attackers choose a selection of target ports on the victim machine (in order of popularity): HTTP, NTP, SSH, gaming services and DNS.
Noting that many of thes services run on \emph{TCP}, it seems likely that attackers are hoping for firewalls to blindly allow through both TCP and UDP on these ports.
Their randomised scanning techniques imply that the culprits behind similar scans could be detected via network telescopes (although it is unclear whether this would reveal the bots, the organiser or the botmaster).

As an aside, the NTP \texttt{monlist} command fragments its $\sim$\SI{50}{\kibi\byte} payload into \SI{482}{\byte} chunks.

\paragraph{Countermeasures}
\textcite{DBLP:conf/ndss/Rossow14}.
?? AS-level---prevent IP spoofing by internal clients.
?? Protocol-level---harden w/ session handling (QUIC, Steam mostly, DTLS) at expense of latency, symmetry of req/resp size, rate limiting resps (limited use).
?? ISP-level---packet filtering on port, len, substring.

?? BGP magic against transit-link attacks and regular \cite{DBLP:conf/sp/SmithS18}.

According to \textcite{DBLP:conf/imc/JonkerKKRSD17}, the most-used techniques in deployment are \emph{DDoS Protection Services}.
While typically proprietary in nature, we see a split between \emph{cloud services}, \emph{in-line systems} (middleboxes) and hybrids thereof.

Cloud services (traffic scrubbers) are known to be most appropriate for handling volumetric attacks and are externally hosted, analysing and filtering out malicious traffic by having services redirect all inbound communication for processing.
The act of redirection is often made cheaper and/or feasible by the use of selective BGP advertisement or DNS modification, aided by reverse proxy or \emph{Generic Routing Encapsulation} (GRE).
Amongst these, BGP-based diversion is most effective where many hosts must be protected, and DNS works most reliably for single-host installations.

In-line systems, hosted within a service's domain of control, are most useful for handling semantic attacks as these often admit \emph{attack signatures} (since they must exploit a particular bug in the server).
Similarly, such attacks tend not to exhibit long-term characteristics that cloud scrubbers might use to aid detection, as many of these attacks present themselves as a single packet.

These authors further find that being attacked does not necessarily increase the likelihood of moving to a DPS---what is an effective indicator is the \emph{strength} of attack targeting a particular service.
To explain, around a fifth of targets already had a DPS prior to an attack, and only \SI{4}{\percent} of victims without a DPS migrate to one.

\Textcite{DBLP:conf/lcn/BragaMP10} have examined the detection of ongoing (flooding-based) DDoS attacks through \emph{self-organising maps}, making use of SDN to gather statistics effectively.
Many of their features aren't overly relevant, as their focus is not active defence or discovering \emph{which} hosts are contributing to an attack.

?? AmpPot \cite{DBLP:conf/raid/KramerKMNKYR15}

\emph{SPIFFY} \cite{DBLP:conf/ndss/KangGS16} aims to remedy transit-link attacks by observing how flows from each source respond to a sudden increase in available bandwidth.
\Citeauthor{DBLP:conf/ndss/KangGS16} realise that bots participating in an attack are often unable to match this bandwidth expansion due to having already saturated the capacity of their outbound links, while legitimate flows typically speed up to match the new fair-share rate.
%Attackers must either be detected or reduce the throughput of each bot, increasing the cost of launching an attack.
Unlike our approach (and due to the class of attacks it is designed to defend against), SPIFFY is intended to be deployed within ISP networks, although some of our feature choices are backed by similar observations.
?? Flaws? what can't it do that we can do better? Long times to compute TBE routes on real networks, low expansion factor in real network can require more ``rounds'' of filtering. (``takes only'' \SI{14}{\second} for Cogent network? gross.)
?? I believe their assumptions may not extend to CBR traffic (e.g., UDP VoIP traffic), which we know makes up a sizeable proportion of network traffic.

\emph{Athena} \cite{DBLP:conf/dsn/LeeKSPY17} is a more generalised SDN framework for intrusion detection, but has shown the use of a \emph{k-nearest neighbours} classifier to detect individual attack flows.
Although heavyweight (and proven to be effective compared with \textcite{DBLP:conf/lcn/BragaMP10}), their comparison against SPIFFY lacks the quantitative evidence required to understand how the system compares.

SENSS \cite{DBLP:conf/acsac/RamanathanMYZ18} aims to help hosts and/or \emph{endpoint-servers} communicate upstream with ISPs.
The rationale is that, although DDoS traffic can be filtered at any point along its path it will impact less of the network if it is filtered \emph{close to its source}---this observation holds true in all attack classes (direct, reflection, LFA/crossfire), which exhibit a tree-like pattern of traffic.
This information currently propagates through human channels, eventually leading to traffic black-holing being performed by key ASes.
The core idea is that the \emph{victim} should be given responsibility for intelligence and decision-making, who pass on their requests to ISPs (alongside ample payment)---they are able to show that this approach functions for multiple algorithms.
The need for payment does seem odd at the outset, but it becomes clear that this is a necessary mechanism to enable ``remote networks to collaborate on demand, without prior trust''.
While all the software engineering work seems well-considered, it appears to hinge on the condition that HTTP/TCP sessions can be reliably held over the saturation zone between high-priority endpoints---they do admit that alternative channels may be possible through elected proxies or UDP-based mechanisms like DOTS \cite{ietf-dots-use-cases-17}.
The mitigation strategies they propose do hold water, and strike me as interesting---using NAT for true outbound requests as a mechanism for reflector filtering close-to-source, similar techniques to others to ``route around'' the congestion added by LFAs, and location-based filtering for signature-free attacks.
What I'm concerned about is the degree of collaboration required; it seems likely to me that there may exist e.g., amplifiers who are difficult to block in such a manner due to non-cooperative ASes on their path, with geography and network uncleanliness as contributing factors...
Their evaluation is convincing---a mixture of a testbed experiment over a small-scale environment (Iperf + ``custom UDP flood'') and an AS-level simulation recreating the DDoS attack on Dyn (gravity model \cite{DBLP:journals/ccr/Roughan05}, cogent topology from Topology Zoo \cite{topology-zoo}).

?? Collaborative soln (?) \cite{DBLP:journals/tnsm/SimpsonSMJPH18}

\Textcite{DBLP:conf/sp/SmithS18} present techniques based on AS-level routing to tackle both transit-link and flooding-based attacks.
This view is taken due to the perceived cost of per-stream classification and inherent sensitivity to adversarial examples or crafted input.
The approach is creative, relying upon BGP \emph{fraudulent route reverse poisoning} to preserve traffic to a target AS, but unlike SPIFFY the approach doesn't actually \emph{remove} the congestion.
Because of this, traditional flooding-based attacks aren't fully alleviated.

?? DDoS Open Threat Signalling \cite{ietf-dots-use-cases-17} as an architecture to maybe enable the deployment of many of these?
