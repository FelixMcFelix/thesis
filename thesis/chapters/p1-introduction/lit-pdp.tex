\chapter{Programmable Data-Planes}

?? arbitrarily reconfigurable hardware located directly on the data path

?? mention how it came to this: this was an alternate solution to latency/throughput concerns which plague VNF approaches as they scale (see Metron paper for good discussion of RSS, etc., which solve these problems in their own way)

?? new ways to implement stateful + stateless packet processing.

?? History? RMT~\parencite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/BosshartGKVMIMH13}, ClickNP, GPU offload papers. See Metron paper for cites.

\sidenote{Test text hello.}

?? RMT was the first big innovation over OpenFlow --- read this!!

\section{Control and Management}

?? Refer back to History through OpenFlow -- what prompted the evolution?

?? Control of these devices has a lot in common with OpenFlow -- controller, except using commodity hardware to install firmwares, and so on,

\section{Software Frameworks}

\subsection{eBPF}
?? eBPF

?? BPFabric

\subsection{P4}
?? P4

?? Others who lost?

?? How do these differ? What do they share?

?? Popular frameworks now support this -- ONOS, eBPF translators, behavioural model software switch...

\section{Use Cases}

\subsection{In-Network Computation}
?? In-network computation.\sidenote{Test text hello.}

\subsection{Network Telemetry}
?? Others (try to avoid DDN cases here).

\subsection{Transport Layer Optimisation}
?? Hi~\parencite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/ArashlooLGRWW20} Network stacks being moved into NICs to reduce latency/CPU utilisation, mainly for datacentre use-cases---otherwise, \SI{100}{\giga\bit\per\second} can't be hit. New API \emph{Tonic} for transport layer in user code (send, data management), DMA to NIC and let it handle all (de)packetisation. ``Transport logic'' goes to Tonic. Main design is datacentres, so not very high BDPs (long-fat) $\rightarrow$ \si{\kilo\byte} inflight data.

\subsection{Active Queue Management}
Turns out that you can't just write it in P4, you need to co-design for the target environment---with meaningful performance cost to boot, based on the tradeoffs you need to make~\parencite{Kunze-P4-AQM}.

\section{Hardware Designs}

?? Mention FPGA vs many-core

?? P4 etc. can actually all run on commodity hardware, which offers a third (suboptimal) hardware class.

?? Ref the paper that Haruna presented \parencite{haruna-rg-paper} (look for up-to-date cite from dblp regularly): pareto front of work-division optimality for SmartNICs (i.e., addition of high-latency cores).

?? How do these limit and influence what code can be run on different device classes? The time taken to adapt the network?
