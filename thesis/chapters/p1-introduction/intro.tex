\section{Overview}

Run over the main topics in the thesis: take the time to explain both thoroughly and personably.

\subsection{Why we want DDN}

\subsection{Why we want to run complex stuff in the network}

\subsection{The complexities of running complex stuff in the network}

\subsection{The intersection}

\section{Thesis Statement}

These statement: if there are one or two phrases which sum it all up, what are they?

\section{Contributions}

From the main goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{A thorough summary of the literature on modern computer networks (including recent hardware trends), and of machine learning techniques suitable for their control (??)}. Describe in detail... \textbf{Link this to a specific part of the thesis statement.}
	\item \emph{A novel synthesis of best practices, design decisions, and environmental tradeoffs to consider in the design of \gls{acr:ml}-led system control (\cref{sec:ddn-use-takeaways})}. Describe in detail... \textbf{Link this to a specific part of the thesis statement.}
	\item \emph{Marl DDoS (\cref{sec:uk})}. Describe in detail... \textbf{Link this to a specific part of the thesis statement.}
	\item \emph{In-Network RL (\cref{sec:uk})}. Describe in detail... \textbf{Link this to a specific part of the thesis statement.}
	\item \emph{\seidr{} (\cref{sec:uk})}. Describe in detail... \textbf{Link this to a specific part of the thesis statement.}
\end{itemize}

In addition to the main goals:
\begin{itemize}
