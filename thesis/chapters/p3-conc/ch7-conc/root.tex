\section{Future directions}
?? OPaL: In future, we aim to examine the performance of individual applications driven by \approachshort---both classical and \gls{acr:drl}-based---and how a NetFPGA implementation can offer further latency and throughput improvements.
A promising avenue here would be to investigate constant transfer learning between online \approachshort{} agents and high-throughput offline function approximators such as \glspl{acr:bnn}.
