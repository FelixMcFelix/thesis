Post-viva changes and minor corrections \[section references describe old ToCs\]:

* Removed Sec 3.4 – Collaborative training.
  * Mention of FL and distributed ML placed into Intro to Ch 3 as 'out-of-scope'.
  * Contribs, summaries in Ch.1 adapted to limit mention of "how networks can benefit ML" to PDP use cases.

* Removed Sec 3.3.5 – Modern RL algorithms.
  * These algorithms do not feature in any future technical chapters, and mostly consist of neural network-based adaptations so have limited applicability or capability to adapt in-network.
  * Folded and trimmed discussion of ES methods into tail end of Sec 3.3.4.

* Renamed Sec 3.3.6 – "RL design considerations" -> "RL use considerations".

* Removed "Tooling" paragraph from Sec 3.3.6 – Learning an approximation.

* Minor typos in Ch 2, 3.
